<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he *Star Wars* 5th Edition roleplaying game is<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; about storytelling in worlds of lightsabers and the Force. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, SW5e is driven by imagination. It�s about picturing the towering AT-AT beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a troup of solider might overcome the challenges that scene presents.

This book is designed to add another significant layer to your SW5e experience. The rules are designed to work alongside the traditional SW5e ruleset, and so an experienced player should have no trouble jumping right into the book. For the less experienced-or more curious-player, this Introduction discusses the basics.

<div class='descriptive'>

<br>

**Game Master (GM):** As your ship exits hyperspace above the moon of Nar Shaddaa, you see a series of snubfighters move to approach your freighter in an offensive formation. Several other craft go about their business in the vicinity, paying no attention to your potential predicament.

**Drew (playing Dash):** I want to hail them and see what their intentions are.

**Rickey (playing Vinto):** I'm going to go man the dorsal gun, just in case.

</div>

Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers� action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their starship can scale a skim the surface of a star destroyer, break the lock on a concussion missile, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

<div class='descriptive'>

<br>

**Game Master (GM):** OK, one at a time. Drew, you're hailing the newcomers?

**Rickey:** Yeah. Do they respond?

**DM:** Make a Charisma check.

**Rickey:** Does my Persuasion skill apply?

**DM:** Sure!

**Rickey (rolling a d20):** Ugh. Seven.

**DM:** You can hear the click of static, but no voice responds to you. And Rickey, Vinto is manning the dorsal gun?

</div>

&emsp;In the Dungeons and Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends). Working together, the group might obtain a freighter and take to the stars, expanding the scope and potential of their game. They might become pirates, the scourge of the Outer Rim, or they may accept missions from a leading faction. They may become smugglers, taking jobs as they see fit, or become bounty hunters in the employee of a powerful hutt.

One player, however, takes on the role of the Game Master (GM), the game�s lead storyteller and referee. The GM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The GM might describe an ongoing naval battle, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they choose a side and join in the combat? Will they attempt to mediate a truce? Or will they simply choose a new destination?

Then the GM determines the results of the adventurers� actions and narrates what they experience. Because the GM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.

The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a **campaign**. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each force defeated, each adventure completed, and each relic recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer�s level and deployment rank, as well as their starship's tier.

There�s no winning and losing in the Dungeons and Dragons game�at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the GM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, dispatched by a Sith lord. The party itself might meet it's devise should it bite off more than it can chew in a starship encounter. Even so, the other adventurers can beseech a powerful Jedi to revive their fallen comrade, or the players might choose (or be forced) to create new characters to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.

## Take to the Stars
One of the premier components of *Star Wars* 5th Edition, versus a traditional Dungeons and Dragons campaign, is the wide variety of planets a character can visit and explore. To facilitate and encourage that experience, adventurers need a means to travel.

<div class='footnote'>INTRODUCTION</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

Public transportation exists, and players can simply pay someone else to transport them if they so desire. Alternatively, you can elect to keep the scope of a campaign small, and limit it to one or two planets. It would be easy to run a game on Coruscant, with its myriad cultures and territories, without the players having to venture offworld.

But if your players want to journey among the stars, this book is designed to those ends.

## Using This Book
The *Starships of the Galaxy* is divided into three parts.

**Part 1** is about taking your SW5e character, adopting a deployment, and designing a ship. It includes information on the five main deployments, the five ship size classifications, ship upgrades, ship equipment, and the customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don�t understand, consult the book�s index. 

**Part 2** details the rules of how to run this portion of the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. This part covers where the rules deviate from the ground game, and where they remain the same. 

**Part 3** is for GMs, and covers the rules for generating encounters and ships, as well as the stats for stock ships off which players can build.

## How to Play
Generally, the space game runs almost identical to the ground. The GM still describes the environment, and the players describe what they want to do. The GM then narrates the results of of the adventurers' actions.

### Game Dice
The game uses the same polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides, referenced in the same fashion; the different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. 

><br>
>
> The most important distinction here is the scaling down of the dice. An X-wing's laser cannon deals 1d6 to an enemy X-wing. The perspective for damage here is space. If you need to scale ships to the perspective of players, you want to scale the damage, hit points, shield points, and shield regeneration rate of ships, as shown below on the Starship Size Value Scaling table.
>
> #### Starship Size Value Scaling
> |Starship Size|Value Scaling|
> |:--|--:|
> |Tiny|x 10|
> |Small|x 10|
> |Medium|x 10|
> |Large|x 100|
> |Huge|x 1,000|
> |Gargantuan|x 10,000|

\columnbreak

### The D20
The same d20 that a Jedi uses to swing his lightsaber is used for firing a ship's weapons. The biggest deviation here is that when a player fires a ship weapon, they use the player's proficiency bonus, *but the ship's Dexterity bonus*. The reason for this is two-fold:

**1. In the ground game, Dexterity is predominantly stronger than Strength.** Since this is designed to enhance the way the game is played, one character should not be penalized for being slightly different from another character.

**2. How accurate a ship's weapons are is modified by the ship's maneuverability.** A ship with a higher Dexterity is more maneuverable than a ship with a low Dexterity, consequently yielding a greater likelihood of accuracy.

This deviation will be discussed at greater length in **Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores**.

### Advantage and Disadvantage
Advantage and Disadvantage function identical to the ground game; with advantage, you roll two dice and take the higher value, while with the disadvantage you roll two dice and take the lesser.

### Specific Beats General
In the same vein, while latter chapters contain broad strokes for the game's rules, certain deployment or ship features override those rules, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: if a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.

### Round Down
There�s one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater, unless otherwise specified.

## What It Brings
The **Starships of the Galaxy** is designed to be an *in addition to* rather than *instead of*. The rules here, predominantly, function identically to the ground game, but the features and boons achieved here are designed to be kept separate. While features of the ground game, such as your characters' species, classes, backgrounds, and customization options impact your character's prowess in the space game, the space game should not affect your characters in the ground game. 

As always, there might be some exceptions to this rule; for instance, many of the suite options offer bonuses that affect the ground game, and players can use their ship to assault a stronghold that their character's might not be able to conquer on their own. Ultimately, the cross over is up to the GM to adjudicate.

# Chapter 1: Step-By-Step Starships

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/5CsIIIt.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:55px;width:37px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our first step in transitioning to the space portion<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of your *Star Wars* 5th Edition campaign is imagining how having a starship impacts your character. When participating in the space portion of the game, your character is impacted by a number of features, including their chosen deployment, the size and style of ship on which they adventure, and the modification and equipment that ship has access to. These choices can enhance and enrich your avatar.

Before you dive into step 1 below, think about where your adventurer would be most likely to participate in a starship. You might be a dauntless pilot, or a crushing gunner. Perhaps you are a genius mechanic, an intricate operator, or a charming pilot. Maybe you are interested in a mixture of these roles. 

Additionally, what kind of ship, and your intended purpose, can impact these decisions. Do you want to be a soldier in the Imperial Navy, piloting a TIE fighter and leading a squadron? Or are you more inclined to travel as a mercenary aboard a light freighter, taking jobs as you see fit in order to keep your ship in space? Maybe you instead want to be a bounty hunter in an assault craft, tracking your quarry to the Outer Rim, and beyond?

Once you have an idea in mind, follow these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character and ship you want. Your conception of your character and starship might evolve with each choice you make. What�s important is that you come to the table with a character you�re excited to play.

Throughout this section, we use the term **deployment sheet** and **starship sheet** to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it�s a formal sheet (like the ones at the end of these rules), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. The official SW5e sheets are a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.

> ##### Building the Millennium Falcon
> Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player building the iconic starship the Millennium Falcon, as it is portrayed during the events of Episode IV.

\columnbreak

### 1. Choose a Deployment
Every character has a role on the ship. There are five major roles directly tied to the control of a starship: coordinator, gunner, mechanic, operator, and pilot. How your character interacts with your ship�or enemy ships�is determined by where they are deployed on the ship. The **Deployments** chapter provides more information about each deployment.

The deployment you choose is the first impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each of the five deployments has a unique and tangible function, and many of them interact with�and synergize�with your character's species and class features. As you progress through the ranks of your chosen deployment, you unlock unique features that augment and enhance your interaction with that deployment, potentially granting you new actions, or simply improving the actions already available to your deployment.

#### Rank
Typically, a character starts their space journey at deployment rank 0, and advances through the ranks (up to 5th) over time. A rank 0 character is typically inexperienced in the ways of their starship, although he or she might have been on a starship previously.

Starting off at rank 0 marks your character's entry in the spacefarer life. If you're already familiar with the game, or if you are joining an existing SW5e campaign, your DM might decide to have you begin at a higher rank, on assumption that your character has already survived a few harrowing adventures. Record your rank on your deployment sheet. If you're starting at a higher rank, record the additional elements your deployment specialization grants you.

> ##### Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 1
> Before we build the Falcon, we start with her pilot: Han Solo. Han is a versatile character aboard a ship, but he is strongest in the piloting role (best in the galaxy). 
>
> When Han achieves his first rank, we spend that rank in the pilot deployment specialization, unlocking the Piloting Procedure and Venture deployment features. For his Piloting Procedure, we mark that Han has two tactical dice, which are d4s. Additionally, Han knows two tactics: for these we choose Koiogran Turn and Snap Roll. For his Venture, we choose Skillful Gunner.

\pagebreakNum

### 2. Acquire a Starship
A crew is nothing without its starship, and this chapter covers the acquisition and initial set up of starships. Like classes and deployments, starships have their own features that are driven by their size category. The **Starships** chapter provides more information about acquiring a starship, starship size categories, and starship features.

What starship you acquire is the second impactful decision you make when you adopt the space portion of your campaign. Each size category of starship has unique and tangible features, and determines what kind of crew your starship can support. A Small starship, for instance, can support 1-2 crew members at tier 0, while a Medium starship can support an entire adventuring party. At larger sizes, the crew shifts into the hundreds and thousands of crew members a ship can support.

#### Tier
Once you've obtained your starship�through any number of ways�you gain the ability to upgrade your ship. Typically, like deployments, starships are obtained at tier 0. A tier 0 ship is typically newly constructed, or otherwise not yet battle tested or broken in.

Starting off at tier 0 marks the beginning of your starships journey and evolution. Over time, with the use of resources and workers�and credits�a starship can be upgraded from tier 0 all the way up to tier 5, unlocking unique features�and choices�as it improves.

#### Hit Points and Hit Dice
Your starship�s hit points define how tough your ship is in combat and other dangerous situations. Your hit points are determined by your Hit Dice (short for Hit Point Dice).

At tier 0, your starship has a varying quantity and size of Hit Die, depending on its size category. Your starship starts with hit points equal to the highest roll of that die, as well as the average roll for each additional Hit Die. You also add your Constitution modifier to each die. This is your **hit point maximum**.

Record your starship�s hit points on your starship sheet. Also record the type of Hit Die your starship uses and the number of Hit Dice it has. After you conduct repairs, you can spend Hit Dice to regain hit points (see �Repairs� in the Adventuring section).

\columnbreak

<br>

> ##### Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 2
> The Millennium Falcon is a heavily modified YT-1300f light freighter, and falls under the Medium size category. The ship starts at tier 0.
>
> As a tier 0 Medium ship, the Millennium Falcon has 5 Hit Dice�which are d8s�and a Constitution modifier of +1. Consequently, the Millennium Falcon has 33 hit points: 8 + the average for the subsequent four dice (5) + the Constitution modifier for each Hit Die (5 x 1).
> 
> When the Millennium Falcon progresses to tier 1 it gains the following features: Starship Improvements and Evasive Maneuvers. We record Evasive Maneuvers on the starship sheet. Since the Millennium Falcon is fast, we increase its Strength with the Ability Score Improvement. It gains an additional Hit Dice, and it's current and maximum hit points increases by 6. It also gains additional modifications, discussed in Chapter 4.
> 
> Additionally, at tier 0, a Medium ship gets a choice of Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throws proficiencies. For the Falcon, we choose Strength.

### 3. Installing Modifications
At tier 0, your starship has a number of modification slots, depending on its size, and it gains more modification slots as it progresses through tiers. Modifications�at the expense of credits, workers, and time�can be installed in these modification slots, enhancing and augmenting the ship's functionality. Modifications fall into five categories: engineering, operation, suite, universal, and weapon. The **Modifications** chapter provides more information about these categories.

> ##### Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 3
> At tier 0, the Millennium Falcon has 10 modification slots. Since it's a Medium ship, it comes with one Barracks at no cost. Additionally, we choose a Living Quarters to give the crew their own rooms. We also choose the Cantina and Storage Compartment suites, bringing the total modifications to 3.
>
> The Millennium Falcon has both a dorsal and ventral cannon, with limited firing arcs (discussed in Chapter 9), so we choose two Fixed Hardpoints. Additionally, these are more effective ship weapons, so we take two Gauss Rounds to augment them. We're up to 7 modifications.
>
> She has a Hyperdrive and Navcomputer, bringing the total modifications to 9.
>
> Finally, the Falcon has exterior protection, so we take the Anti-Boarding System upgrade as our 10th and final upgrade.
>
> When the Falcon reaches tier 1, it gains two more upgrade slots. We choose the Hyperdrive Quick-Start and Improved Navcomputer modifications.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STEP-BY-STEP STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### 4. Choose Equipment
Starships have access to certain types of equipment. Every starship has access to armor and shields, and most have access to weapons. Many starships, especially larger ones, have access to hyperdrives and navcomputers. The **Equipment** chapter provides more information on these categories.

#### Armor Class
Your **Armor Class** (AC) represents how well your starship avoids being damaged in battle. Your AC is determined by three major factors: your starship's size category, the pilot's Piloting skill bonus, and the type of armor your ship has installed.

Your ship has a base AC, depending on its size, as shown in the Starship Size Base Armor Class table on page 56. You then add the pilot's bonus to Piloting checks. Finally, certain types of armor add a bonus or penalty to your ship's AC.

#### Weapons
Your ship can have a number of weapons no greater than the number of hardpoints it has. For each hardpoint, a single weapon can be attached. When making attack rolls, or setting the save DC for ship weapons, we use the starship's Dexterity modifier, and the deployed gunner's proficiency bonus. We also add the ship's Dexterity modifier to damage rolls.

> ##### Building the Millennium Falcon, Step 4
> The Millennium Falcon, as a Medium starship, has a base AC of 8. With an Intelligence of 14, proficiency in Piloting, and Piloting as one of his chosen skills with the Expertise class feature, Han has a +6 bonus to Piloting checks, which we add to the Millennium Falcon's base armor class, for a total of 14. Additionally, the Falcon comes with deflection armor installed, which we will change out for lightweight armor, further increasing the AC to 15. 
> 
> The Falcon has two fixed hardpoints, and we choose traditional laser cannons to equip to them. When making an attack roll with either weapon, we use the ship's Dexterity modifier (+2) and the deployed gunner's proficiency bonus. When making a damage roll, we add the ship's Dexterity modifier (+2). We note that the laser cannons have a limited firing arc, do 1d8 + 2 energy damage, can attack twice per round, and have a range of 450/900.

\columnbreak

### 5. Come Together
Most Star Wars characters don�t work alone, and while some starships can be operated by a single crew member, it is more dynamic�and engaging�to crew a starship with a **party*, with each member of the party fulfilling a needed role on the ship. Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chance to survive the unapologetic lethality of spacefaring.

#### Beyond the Basics
As your characters�and the starship�go on adventures and overcomes challenges, they can increase in their ranks and tiers, respectively. While tiers are driven by the amount of effort�and credits�directly applied to the starship, ranks are earned separately. Generally, the characters should be awarded their first deployment rank after no more than five encounters. After that, they should be awarded at the discretion of the GM.

> The expectation is to tie ranks to proficiency bonuses. When characters reach 5th-level, their proficiency bonus increases to 3, and again at 9th (4), 13th (5), and 17th (6). Ranks 2-4 are designed to be awarded at or around those same improvements.

#### Features and Hit Dice
When your starship gains a tier, it unlocks additional features, depending on its size, as detailed in the description. Some of these features allow you to increase your starship's ability scores. You can�t increase an ability score above 20. 

Each time your starship gains a tier, it gains gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your ship's Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).

When your ship's Constitution modifier increases by 1, its hit point maximum increases by 1 for each Hit Dice it has. For example, if your tier 0 Medium ship has a Constitution score of 14, when it reaches tier 1, you increases its Constitution score from 14 to 16, thus increasing its Constitution modifier from +2 to +3. At tier 0, your Medium starship has a total of 6 Hit Dice, so its hit point maximum then increases by 6.

# Chapter 2: Deployments

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dventurers are extraordinary people, driven<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can�t stand against.

Deployments are roles your characters can fill that are not directly correlated with their class. A character can then specialize in a specific deployment, granting a variety of features, such as the gunner's gambits or the pilot's tactics. As you progress in your deployment specialization, you gain more powerful features, and some features improve. Each deployment specialization entry in this chapter includes a table summarizing the benefits you gain at every rank, and a detailed explanation of each one.

Each ship has a number of deployments determined by its size and class. A TIE Fighter, for instance, only has a singe deployment, who controls all of the aspect of his fighter. The Millennium Falcon, however, has space 

<br> for a pilot, two gunners, a mechanic, a coordinator, and an operator. Each deployment has specific tasks and abilities related to its function. 

> Unlike classes, when players achieve the space portion of the game, they start at rank 0. Players should attempt to experience multiple roles to see which suits them best before choosing the one in which they will specialize.

A character can fill multiple roles simultaneously, provided it can reach the appropriate equipment to utilize that deployment's features.

> When engaging in the space portion of a campaign, many class features work in conjunction with a ship deployment, while others don't. It is up to your GM to determine which is which.

<br>

<div class='classTable wide'>

##### Deployments
|Deployment&nbsp;&nbsp;|Description|
|:--|:--|
|Coordinator|Provides motivation and organization to the crew|
|Gunner|Controls one or more weapon emplacements|
|Mechanic|Controls the functionality of the ship itself, including the ability to make repairs|
|Operator|Uses ship systems to interfere with and disable the enemy|
|Pilot|Controls the movement and tactics of the ship|

## Coordinator
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Mon Calamari admiral surveys the battlefield, noting the</span>  positioning of his outnumbered fleet. With a quick barking of orders, he directs his officers to relay that his fleet should prepare to converge on the opposing capital ship, with the knowledge that if they can disrupt the enemy's plans, their mission is complete.

The Sith Lord maneuvers his interceptor into formation with his apprentices. Communicating through encrypted channels, he directs them to move outward to flank their quarry. As they converge from the sides, the Sith launches a debilitating volley, disrupting his prey's systems and readying the ship for capture.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. As the twi'lek pilot begins evasive maneuvers, the human coordinator immediately jumps to action. He directs his crew towards their stations, while reaching out with the Force. As each of his respective crew members settles into their respective roles, he directs their actions to coincide, leading his team to victory.

Without coordination, many a ship would fall to disorganization and a chaos. It is the job of the coordinator to facilitate communication and teamwork, and to keep his ship, or fleet, productive.

\columnbreak

<div class='classTable'>

##### The Coordinator
| Rank | Feature |
|:---:|:---|
| 1st | Venture, Inspiring Display |
| 2nd | Uplifting Directive, Call to Arms  |
| 3rd | Versatile Coordinator, Commanding Presence |
| 4th | Masterful Directive, Contingency Plan  |
| 5th | Paragon Coordinator, Rallying Cry |

</div>

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Inspiring Display
Also at 1st rank, you can inspire others through stirring words. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Inspiring Display die, a d4.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Inspiring Display die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Inspiring Display die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Inspiring Display die at a time.

You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your Inspiring Display die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Uplifting Directive
At 2nd rank, while aboard your ship, you can use the Direct action with a range of 60 feet, as long as the target can hear and understand you.

Additionally, when you take the Direct action, roll a d20. Note the number on the d20. This becomes your uplifting directive number.

While you have an uplifting directive number, when an ally makes an ability check or attack roll affected by your Direct action, you can replace the result of a d20 roll with the value of the uplifting directive roll. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. You can only have one uplifting directive roll at a time, and you lose any unused uplifting directive rolls when you complete a short or long rest.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | DEPLOYMENTS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Call to Arms
Also at 2nd rank, while aboard your ship, if you are surprised at the start of combat and aren't incapacitated, you and a creature who can see or hear you may act normally on their first turn.

### Versatile Coordinator
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would expend an Inspiring Display die, you can instead use a d4. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Commanding Presence
Also at 3rd rank, you learn a new way to use your Inspiring Display. While aboard your ship, when a creature that can see or hear you fails an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can use use your reaction and expend a use of your Inspiring Display to aid that creature provided it did not already have or use an Inspiring Display die this turn. The creature can then roll the die and add it to the result.

### Masterful Directive
At 4th rank, when you roll your uplifting directive number as a part of the Direct action, you can use your bonus action to increase your uplifting directive number by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If this would increase the value of your uplifting directive number to more than 20, it instead becomes 20.

\columnbreak

### Contingency Plan
Also at 4th rank, while aboard your ship, you can choose two allies, instead of one, when you take the Direct action. Additionally, while aboard your ship, you can use the Direct action with a range of 1 mile, as long as the target can hear and understand you. 

### Paragon Coordinator
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. You regain all expended uses of your Inspiring Display feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you roll an uplifting directive number, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Rallying Cry
Also at 5th rank, as a bonus action, you can extend a rallying cry to those that can hear you. Choose a number of friendly creatures up to twice your Charisma modifier that can see or hear you. Each of those creatures gains an Inspiring Display die that lasts until the end of your next turn. This die does not count against your number of Inspiring Display uses, but creatures can still only have one Inspiring Display die at a time. When a creature uses this die, they take the maximum instead of rolling.

Once you've used this feature, you can�t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Gunner
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The trandoshan bounty hunter hides in his assault craft</span> behind a nearby asteroid, patiently awaiting his prey. As it passes along its predetermined course, the trandoshan detonates the seismic charges, disintegrating the ship.

As the gunship moves away from its parent vessel, the zabrak soldier begins scoping out the opposing fleet. As the two forces engage, the gunner chooses his target, engaging his railgun. After its 3-second charge time, a massive blast of energy projects towards his target, vaporizing it instantly.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human runs to her gunning station, hops into the chair, and engages the controls. As her twi'lek pilot maneuvers the ship out of danger, the gunner draws a bead on the offending snubfighter, before unleashing a quick 1-2 volley and detonating them in a fiery blaze.

Whether coming from a military, criminal, or civilian background, all gunners share the same love of precise and effective destruction of their targets.

| 1st | Venture, Gunner Stratagem |
| 2nd | Gunning Style, Improved Critical |
| 3rd | Versatile Gunner, Brutal Critical |
| 4th | Gunning Mastery, Protean Gunner |
| 5th | Paragon Gunner, Maximum Power |

</div>

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Gunner Stratagem
Also at 1st rank, you learn gambits that are fueled by special dice called gambit dice.

#### Gambits
You learn two gambits of your choice, which are detailed under "Gambits" below. Many gambits enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one gambit per attack, and you can only use each gambit once per turn.

You learn an additional gambit at 3rd and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new gambit, you can also replace one gambit you know with a different one.

#### Gambit Dice
You have two gambit dice, which are d4s. A gambit die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended gambit dice when you finish a long rest.

You gain another gambit die at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. Additionally, your gambit die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your gambits require your target to make a saving throw to resist the gambit�s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Gambit save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus +<br> your ship's Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

### Gambits
The gambits are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Crippling Shot
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one gambit die to cripple it. You add the gambit die to the attack's damage roll, and the ship's flying speed reduced by half until the end of their next turn.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | DEPLOYMENTS</div>

\pagebreakNum

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Disabling Shot
When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one gambit die to add it to the roll. On a hit, the ship has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the end of your next turn.

#### Distracting Shot
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one gambit die to give your allies an opening. You add the gambit die to the attack�s damage roll, and the next attack roll against the target by someone other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.

#### Explosive Shot
When you reduce a ship to 0 hit points, you can expend one gambit die and use a bonus action on your turn to make one additional ship attack against a different ship within range. If that attack hits, add the gambit die to the attack�s damage roll.

#### Expose Weakness
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend a gambit die and deal additional damage equal to the number rolled. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

#### Feinting Shot
You can expend one gambit die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one ship within your weapon's normal range as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that ship. If that attack hits, add the gambit die to the attack�s damage roll.

#### Penetrating Shot
When you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can expend one gambit die to attempt to damage another ship with the same attack. Choose a second ship within 150 feet of and directly behind your initial target. If the original attack roll would hit the second ship, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your gambit die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

#### Precision Shot
When you make a ship attack roll against a ship, you can expend one gambit die to add it to the roll. If that attack hits, add the gambit die to the attack�s damage roll. You can use this gambit before or after making the attack roll, but before any effects of the attack are applied.

\columnbreak

### Gunning Style
At 2nd rank, you adopt a particular style of gunning as your specialty. Choose one of the Gunning Style options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Improved Critical
Also at 2nd rank, your primary and secondary ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and when a ship rolls a 1 on a saving throw against a tertiary weapon, they take damage as if suffering a critical hit.

### Versatile Gunner
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would expend a Gambit die, you can instead use a d4. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Brutal Critical
Also at 3rd rank, you can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship weapon.

### Gunning Mastery
At 4th rank, you master a particular style of gunning. Choose one of the Gunning Mastery options, detailed in Chapter 6. You can't take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

### Protean Gunner
Also at 4th rank, you can choose a second Gunning Style option.

### Paragon Gunner
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. You regain all expended uses of your Gunner Stratagem feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you make an attack roll while deployed as a gunner, you can choose to make the roll a critical hit. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Maximum Power
Also at 5th rank, when you hit a ship with a ship attack, you can deal maximum damage with that attack. 

Once you've used this feature, you can�t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Mechanic
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">Flinching occasionally as a blaster bolt hits the nearby</span> bulkhead, a Sullustan mechanic quickly solders a large wire. He peers through his tinted goggles, ignoring the shouts of his ship captain as the enemy descends on the hanger. Finally he shouts with pride as the repaired coupling powers up, causing the frigate to hum with energy. He gathers his tools and runs into the ship moments before it finally takes off. 

Staggering in time with the rocking ship, the ortolan mechanic rushes down the hallway, hanging wires obstructing her path. As she dodges and jumps over the impediments, she finally reaches the shield generator. With a quick twist of her hydrospanner and a graceless hit with a hammer, she opens the protective cover and reengages the ship's shields. The familiar hum as they power up brings a smile to her lips.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. In the cockpit, the sounds of a muffled explosion can be heard. With a shrill chirp, the droid mechanic jumps to action, rushing towards the source of the explosion. As it enters the engine room, it identifies the source of the explosion, and quickly moves to repair the damage.

While mechanics come from all walks of life, they all share one thing in common; they gather an immense satisfaction from keeping their ship running.

| 5th | Paragon Mechanic, Supreme Boost |

</div>

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### System Boost
Also at 1st rank, while aboard your ship, you learn to quickly augment and repair different systems on your ship. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can choose an accessible system on your ship and give it a boost. Roll a System Boost die, which is a d4. The die benefits ship system differently:
- **Engines:** Take the result of the die and multiply it by 50. The flying speed of your ship increases by this amount until the end of your next turn. 
- **Shields:** Your shields immediately regenerate by the result of the die.
- **Weapons:** The next time a ship weapon deals damage before the end of your next turn, it deals additional damage equal to the result of the die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your System Boost die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Quick Fixer
At 2nd rank, when you take the Patch action or conduct ship repairs, you have advantage on the Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit). If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/wsfIqqe.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-60px;left:-0px;width:435px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | DEPLOYMENTS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Ship Technician
Also at 2nd rank, when installing new equipment or upgrades, you count as two members of a workforce, instead of one. 

Additionally, when your ship's shields are fully depleted, you can use your reaction to immediately restore a number of shield points equal to your Intelligence modifier. Once you've used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

### Versatile Mechanic
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would expend a System Boost die, you can instead use a d4. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Reroute Power
Also at 3rd rank, as an action on each of your turns, you can reroute power between your ship's engines, shields, and weapons through use of the ship's capacitor. A capacitor can be toggled to neutral, where all three aspects function normally, or can divert power to a specific system. 

When diverting power to a system, the effects of that system are doubled: 
- **Engines:** A ship's flying speed is doubled.
- **Shields:** Shields take half damage and shield regeneration rate is doubled.
- **Weapons:** Weapons deal double damage. 

When diverting power to a system, power to the other systems is halved: 
- **Engines:** A ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- **Shields:** Shields take double damage and shield regeneration rate reduced by half.
- **Weapons:** Ship weapon damage is reduced by half. 

\columnbreak

### Rapid Repairman
At 4th rank, when you take the Patch action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, you can expend 2 Hit Die, instead of one. For each Hit Die spent in this way, roll the die and add the ship's Constitution modifier to it.

### Last Resort
Also at 4th rank, when your ship makes a Destruction saving throw while you are deployed as a mechanic, it adds your Intelligence modifier to the roll (minimum of +1). Additionally, when you roll a ship's Hit Die to regain hit points, the minimum number of hit points you can regain from the roll equals twice your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 2).

### Paragon Mechanic
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. You regain all expended uses of your System Boost feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you would make a Mechanic's Kit check while deployed as a mechanic, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Supreme Boost
As of 5th rank, you learn to how grant massive brief boost to your ship's system. As a bonus action, you can use your System Boost feature on the engines, shields, and weapons simultaneously, without expending any uses of your System Boost feature. Additionally, instead of rolling your System Boost die, you take the maximum.

Once you've used this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

## Operator
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">"*Watcher's Confidence*, please proceed to docking bay ninety-</span>four," comes over the freighter's speakers for a third time. Frantically, the chiss operator types as fast as he can, attempting to disguise his ship's transponder code and true designation. Finally, with a satisfied sigh and a single keystroke, he completes the new temporary identity to his ship.

Methodically, the voss operator types away on the datapad in front of her, one eye on the console and the other on her quarry. As she sees the ship's trajectory abruptly change, she completes her commands, overloading their systems. The ship immediately slows, it's turning become sluggish, enabling the voss to overtake it.

As the light freighter exits hyperspace, the hull starts to vibrate with the impacts of cannon fire. The human operator immediately jumps into the co-pilot's seat and interfaces with the control panel. He engages a comm scrambler, disrupting the communications of the enemy ships, in an effort to diminish their coordination.

Operators share their love of a challenge; to overcome the obstacle that few others can comprehend. While they aren't always celebrated, operators are an integral part of any ship's crew.

</div>

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### System Disruption
Also at 1st rank, as a bonus action, you can choose a ship that you can see within 1,000 feet and target its systems for disruption, as long as you understand how they function. For the next minute, or until you disrupt another target, you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it.

Additionally, when the ship makes an ability check, attack roll, or damage roll, you can use your reaction to disrupt the ship's functions. Roll a System Disruption die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can choose to use this feature after the ship makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. 

You can use this feature twice. You gain another use of this feature at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank in this deployment. You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Your System Disruption die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Improved Interference
At 2nd rank, when you use take the Interfere action, you have advantage on the Intelligence (Technology) check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

### Disrupted Defenses
Also at 2nd rank, the first time the target of your System Disruption takes damage each round, it takes additional damage equal to your System Disruption die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Versatile Operator
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would expend a System Disruption die, you can instead use a d4. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Threat Assessment
Also at 3rd rank, as a bonus action, you can learn certain information about the capabilities of the target of your System Disruption. The GM tells you if the ship is your ship's equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current total hit and shield points
- Total ship tiers (if any)
- Total deployment ranks (if any)

### Masterful Interference
At 4th rank, when you take the Interfere action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks or attack rolls it makes before the start of your next turn, instead of one.

### Haywire
Also at 4th rank, when you target a ship with your System Disruption feature, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Technology checks). On a failed save, while it is the target of your System Disruption feature, the first time it makes an attack roll or a saving throw each round, the target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

\columnbreak

### Paragon Operator
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. You regain all expended uses of your System Disruption feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you would make a Technology check while deployed as an operator, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Overload Systems
Also at 5th rank, you learn how to overload the systems of a ship remotely. As an action, you can attempt to breach the systems of the target of your System Disruption. The ship must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to Technology checks). On a failed save, the target�s flying speed reduced by half, it's turning speed is doubled, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, it's shields no longer regenerate, and it can�t use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the ship�s abilities, crew, or equipment, it can�t make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.

The ship's pilot makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of its turns. On a successful save, the effect ends.

Once you've use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Venture
Beginning when you choose this deployment as your specialty, at 1st rank, and again at 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th rank, you can choose a venture (see Chapter 6 for a list of ventures).

### Piloting Procedure
Also at 1st rank, you learn tactics that are fueled by special dice called tactical dice.

#### Tactics
You learn two tactics of your choice, which are detailed under "Tactics" below. You can use only one tactic per turn, and you can only use each tactic once per round.

You learn an additional tactic at 3rd and 5th rank in this deployment. Each time you learn a new tactic, you can also replace one tactic you know with a different one.

#### Tactical Dice
You have two tactical dice, which are d4s. A tactial die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended tactical dice when you finish a long rest.

You gain another tactical die at 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th in this deployment. Additionally, your tactical die changes when you reach certain ranks in this deployment. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd rank, a d8 at 3rd rank, a d10 at 4th rank, and a d12 at 5th rank.

### Tactics
The tactics are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Attack Pattern Delta
When your ship makes a ship attack while there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you, you can expend a tactical die to grant advantage to the roll. If the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack's damage roll.

#### Break the Lock
When you fail a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can expend a tactical die to attempt to recover. Roll the die and add the result to the saving throw.

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/vmwsYtZ.png' style='position:absolute;bottom:-26px;left:-130px;width:692px;z-index:1000;transform:scaleX(-1)' />

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Defense Screen
As a bonus action, you can expend a tactical die and take a defensive formation as long as there is a friendly ship within 100 feet of you. When you do so, your AC increases by the amount rolled on the die until the start of your next turn.

#### Koiogran Turn
When you are the target of an attack roll, you can expend a tactical die and attempt to maneuver out of the line of fire. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. You immediately move that many feet in a direction of your choice. The orientation of your ship does not change.

#### Skim the Surface
As a bonus action, you can expend a tactical die and attempt to fly through the space of a hostile ship. Roll the die, take the result, and multiply it by 50. Your ship's flying speed increases by that amount until the end of your turn. Additionally, moving through a hostile ship's space does not count as hostile terrain this turn.

#### Snap Roll
When you are hit by a ship attack, you can expend a tactical die and attempt to roll to mitigate the damage. When you do so, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by the amount rolled on the die.

#### Starship Charge
When you take the Ram action, you can expend a tactical die to increase the damage. On a failed save, the target ship takes additional kinetic damage equal to the amount rolled on the die + your ship's Strength modifier. Your ship has resistance to the additional damage dealt by this tactic.

#### Target Acquired
As a bonus action, you can expend a tactical die and lock on to a target you can see. The next attack roll made by your ship has advantage, and if the attack hits, add the result of the die to the attack's damage roll.

### I'll Try Spinning
At 2nd rank, when you use take the Evade action, you have advantage on the Piloting check. If you already have advantage, you can instead reroll one of the dice once.

\columnbreak

### Evasion
Also at 2nd rank, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of certain area effects. When your ship is subjected to an effect, such as a proton torpedo or a seismic charge, that allows your ship to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on a saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Versatile Pilot
Starting at 3rd rank, when you would expend a Tactical die, you can instead use a d4. You can only use this feature once per round.

### Cunning Avoidance
Also at 3rd rank, once per round, when your ship is hit with a ship attack or fails a saving throw, you can make an Intelligence (Piloting) check, and instead use that value for your AC or saving throw.

### That's a Good Trick
At 4th rank, when you take the Evade action, you can choose to forgo your proficiency bonus. If you succeed on the check, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls it makes against you before the start of your next turn, instead of one.

### Uncanny Dodge
Also at 4th rank, when an attacker that you can see hits your ship with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack�s damage against your ship.

### Paragon Pilot
As of 5th tier, you are a paragon of your deployment. You regain all expended uses of your Pilot Procedure feature when you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, when you would make a Piloting check while deployed as a pilot, you can take the maximum instead of rolling. You can use this feature before or after making the roll, but before any effects of the roll are determined. Once you've used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

### Pilot Extraordinaire
Also at 5th rank, you are a master at the helm. As a bonus action, you can harness your experience in a brief but awe-inspiring burst. Until the end of your next turn, you have advantage on Piloting checks, your ship has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls against you have disadvantage.

Once you've used this feature, you can�t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

# Chapter 3: Starships

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haracters are nothing without their ships, which<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serve as a great source of inspiration and motivation for their adventures. The starship can even be the adventure itself.

The first step is acquisition.

## Acquiring a Ship
Many parties might see fit to merely obtain passage on a vessel as a part of their adventures, and there's nothing wrong with that. Others will want to obtain their own ships as fast as possible as it is a core component to their character. It is at the discretion of the GM to determine when a party should obtain their first starship using one of the following options.

### Joining a Faction
Joining a large faction, such as the Galactic Republic or the Empire might merit the acquisition of a personal starship. Generally, the faction still owns the ship and allows the party to use it as long as they are in accordance with the faction's wishes. Refusing missions or violating the faction's rule may lead to disavowment, pursuit, and eventual repossession of the ship. 

### Shipjacking
The most nefarious (and frankly most enjoyable) way to acquire a starship is to steal one. Shipjacking is an old and extremely dangerous profession. Starport authorities (as well as the original owners) are constantly on the lookout for stolen ships, and if the heroes fail to adequately falsify documentation identifying themselves as the ship's owners, they can find themself in an uncomfortable position.

### Purchasing
The most common method of acquiring a ship is by purchasing. The cost of a brand new "stock" starship can be found below, on the Starship Size Stock Cost table.

#### Starship Size Stock Cost
| Starship Size | Tier 0 Cost&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|:----:|----:|
| Tiny  | 10,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Small  | 50,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Medium  | 100,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Large  | 1,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Huge | 100,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
| Gargantuan | 1,000,000,000 cr&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

How the players afford the ship varies as well. They may be patient, earning the credits to make the purchase over time. Alternatively, they might seek a backer, or a loan through a financial institution.

> Newly constructed starships come with a number of vacant modification slots, which can be filled with modifications. Modifications are discussed in Chapter 4.

\columnbreak

#### Financing
The party could seek the assistance of a financial institute to purchase a starship. Generally, the bank will require 20% of the starship's cost as a down payment, with monthly payments equal to 2% of the cost for the following five years. 

#### A Wealthy Sponsor
Alternatively, the party may be granted the favor of working for a specific wealthy individual, such as a rich aristocrat. Convincing such an individual to finance you, however, can be quite the adventure in-and-of itself. Generally you can only obtain a sponsor if you can prove the relationship will be mutually beneficial.

#### Loan Sharks
As a less appealing (but potentially more interesting) option, the party could seek out a loan shark or an affluent gangster to finance a ship's acquisition. This usually requires less money up front, but requires steeper loan payments (typically 10% of the starship's cost each month for 3 years).

### Building a Ship
Some players might prefer to build a ship instead. Building a ship is generally cheaper than buying it, but requires substantially more effort and patience; building takes time and necessitates use of a shipyard and a substantial workforce. If players elect to build a stock starship instead of purchasing one, it requires half the cost of the finished ship in facilities, labor costs, and raw materials. Additionally, it requires a minimum workforce as shown below on the Starship Size Construction Workforce table.

#### Starship Size Construction Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 3 |
| Small  | 5 |
| Medium  | 10 |
| Large  | 100 |
| Huge | 1,000 |
| Gargantuan | 10,000 |

The amount of time it takes to build a ship depends on the size of the ship and the size of the workforce, calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("starship size construction cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to build a Small ship, with a workforce of 5, would take 20 days. To build a Huge ship, with a workforce of 1,000, however, would take 200 days [100,000,000 / (500 x 1,000)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

## Upgrading a Starship
Once the party has acquired a ship, they can upgrade it over time. Upgrading a ship is a matter of workforce, time, and skill. This assumes the starship you are upgrading is otherwise fully functional (has no missing hit points or damaged systems), the requisite resources and tools are freely available, and you are docked at a spaceport or shipyard. Under less optimal conditions the time, money and skill required could be increased by as much as 100%, and the GM may decide that an upgrade is impossible in these circumstances.

As players sink credits into their starship, they eventually hit certain thresholds that improve the tier of the starship. Achieving higher tiers requires scarcer materials, restricted schematics, and master craftsmen; consequently, it costs more credits As a player increases the tier of their starship, they unlock additional Hit Dice, additional modification slots, and unique size-specific features. The number of credits a party must invest in their ship varies based on the tier they are trying to obtain, as show below in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

#### Base Upgrade Cost by Tier
| Starship Tier | Cost in Credits |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | 3,900 |
| 2 | 77,500 |
| 3 | 297,000 |
| 4 | 620,000 |
| 5 | 1,150,000 |

### Cost Modifiers
It costs more to upgrade the hull of a capital ship than the hull of a starfighter; bigger starships are simply costlier to improve. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table below, which is multiplied by the value for that tier in the Base Upgrade Cost by Tier table.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 10 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 100 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 1,000 |

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from Tier 0 to Tier 1, it costs 3,900 credits. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, however, it costs 29,700,000 (297,000 x 100).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Upgrade Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform these upgrades. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additional workers will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table below.

#### Starship Size Upgrade Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 2 |
| Small  | 3 |
| Medium  | 5 |
| Large  | 50 |
| Huge | 500 |
| Gargantuan | 5,000 |

### Upgrade Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be upgraded in no more than a week's time. However, upgrading a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("base upgrade cost by tier" x "starship size upgrade cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to upgrade a Small size ship from tier 0 to tier 1, with a workforce of 3, would take 2.6 days. To upgrade a Huge size ship from Tier 2 to Tier 3, with a workforce of 500, however, would take 118.8 days [(297,000 x 100) / (500 x 500)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

> Some starship features are only usable once per round. Once they have been used by a deployed crew member, they are not available for use again until the start of that crew member's next turn.

### Starship Tier Features
Once players have upgraded a ship to tier 1 or higher, they unlock additional features, determined by the ship's size.

### Astromech Synergy
Also at 1st tier, your starship gains an interface slot suited for an astromech droid. 

While an astromech droid occupies the interface slot, they function as a deployed crew member, rolling their own initiative and taking their own actions as long as they are not incapacitated. Additionally, deployed crew members can draw on it to enhance one action they take. When a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can roll an Astromech Synergy die, which is a d4, and add it to the roll. This feature can only be used by one deployed crew member, and it can only be used once per round.

Your ship's Astromech Synergy die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

The orientation of the ship does not change.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Versatile Snubfighter
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Maneuvering Jets
Also at 3rd tier, your ship can add half of its Dexterity modifier (rounded down, minimum of one) to its armor class.

## Medium Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The freighter shudders with the blasts of cannon fire. Despite</span> its maneuvers, the pilot can't quite shake the pursuit. Finally, just as the ship's shields dissipate, the pilot makes the gut call, jettisoning the illicit cargo. As it distracts and hampers the followers, the freighter shifts power to the thrusters and quickly flies away.

As the pirates activate their tractor beam to attempt to capture the weaponless frigate and its exotic wares, the gunboat escort intercedes. It flies in the line of the tractor, breaking the lock on the frigate, and unleashes a terrible volley of cannon fire. The pirates, incapable of standing such a salvo, disable the tractor beam and retreat.

The atmosphere set, the captain invites his guests into the cantina. Fully aware of the effect the opulent room has on the unprepared, he gestures for the starry-eyed visitors to sit across from him. He indicates for the server to bring drinks, as he casually leans back and puts his feet on the table, confident that this deal will go in his favor.

Medium ships are the bread and butter of the close-knit group. They are large enough to accommodate all of the immediate needs of a crew, while at the same time being small enough to feel cozy.

### Evasive Maneuvers
Also at 1st tier, when a deployed pilot rolls for initiative, they can immediately move the ship. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

The amount the ship moves is determined by rolling an Evasive Maneuvers die, which is a d4, and multiplying it by 50 feet. The ship then gains that many feet that it can move or spend to turn.

Your ship's Evasive Maneuvers die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 2 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Freighter
When your ship fails a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a deployed crew member can use their reaction to jettison some of the cargo stored in its storage compartments. If you jettison at least 50 tons of cargo, you can reroll the saving throw and must use the new roll. If you jettison at least 75 tons of cargo, however, you instead automatically succeed on the saving throw. Additionally, the area in a line 300 feet long and 100 feet wide behind your ship becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.

#### Gunboat
Once per round, a deployed gunner can roll the weapon damage dice one additional time when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a ship attack.

#### Yacht

## Huge Ships
<span style="font-variant: small-caps">The battleship's shields flickers as it absorbs the blows of the</span>  attacking fighters. It continues inexorably past them, approaching the fragile medical frigate they scramble to protect, before unleashing a fierce volley and snapping it in half.

As the carrier leaves hyperspace, snubfighters deploy in formations and move to intercept. Before the enemy craft has the opportunity to respond, the fighters fall upon them, quickly decimating their ranks.

With the command given, the operator activates the interdictor's gravity well projectors. Accompanied by a low-pitched hum, the gravity well projectors power up. Minutes pass for the ship uneventfully, until finally a frigate lurches unceremoniously out of hyperspace into realspace in front of them. The ship then activates its tractor beam, trapping its quarry.

Huge starships, regardless of their specific purpose, are the backbone of any military. They provide a mobile base of operations and function as a staging ground for the faction that controls them.

## Starship Features
As a Huge starship, it gains the following starship features at tier 0.

Your ship gains 1 additional Hit Die. It gains 1 additional Hit Die at 2nd tier (2), 3rd tier (3), 4th tier (4), and 5th tier (5).

#### Additional Modifications
Your ship gains 4 additional modification slots. It gains 4 additional modification slots at 2nd tier (8), 3rd tier (12), 4th tier (16), and 5th tier (20).

### Damage Control
Also at 1st tier, your starship gains the ability to mitigate damage from ships.

Once per turn, as a reaction to being dealt damage by a ship weapon, a deployed crew member can use their reaction and roll a Damage Control die, which is a d4, and subtract it from the damage roll.

Your ship's Damage Control die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 4 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Battleship
Your ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

#### Carrier
Your ship gains two Docking Bay suites, which do not count against its total modifications or suite systems. Additionally, the capacity of your docking bays are doubled.

#### Interdictor 
Your ship gains the Tractor Beam and Gravity Well Projector modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, ships of Large size or smaller have disadvantage on saving throws against your tractor beams.

### Staging Grounds
Also at 2nd tier, the capacity for your Barracks, Living Quarters, and Luxury Quarters suites are doubled. Additionally, when crew members or troopers deploy, they have advantage on their first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make before the end of their next long rest. Once a crew member or troop has benefited from this feature, they can not benefit from it again until they complete a long rest.

### Versatile Cruiser
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 4 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Capital Railgun
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a forward-mounted railgun at its helm. As an action, a deployed gunner can fire the capital railgun. The capital railgun has a limited firing arc, a close range of 3,000 feet and a normal range of 6,000 feet, can be fired once per round, and it deals 6d10 energy damage on a hit. Attack rolls made with the capital railgun have a +2 bonus.

This weapon does not count towards your ship's maximum number of hardpoints.

\columnbreak

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Battleship
When a deployed gunner rolls a 1 or 2 on the on a damage die for a primary or secondary weapon, they can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

#### Carrier
When ships are deployed from your carrier, they have advantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make before the end of their next maintenance. Once a ship has benefited from this feature, it can not benefit from it again until it undergoes maintenance.

#### Interdictor
Ships of Huge size or smaller have disadvantage on the saving throws against your tractor beams. If they already have disadvantage, you can instead force them to reroll one of the dice once.

### Broadside
Also at 4th tier, once on each of their turns, when a deployed gunner makes a ship attack, they can make another attack with the same weapon against a different ship that is within 100 feet of the original target and within range of their weapon.

### Paragon Cruiser
As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score increases by 4, and the other two ability scores increase by 2. Its maximum for this score increases by 4, and for the other two ability scores by 2.

### Capital Ship
Also at 5th tier, a deployed coordinator can, as a bonus action, delegate a plan of action to the crew. The ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five deployed crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

| 3rd | Versatile Dreadnought, Superweapon |
| 4th | Role Mastery, Citadel |
| 5th | Paragon Dreadnought, Devastator | 

</div>

### Starship Improvements
Beginning when your ship reaches 1st tier, it gains the following benefits:

#### Ability Score Improvement
You can increase your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 2, or you can increase two of these ability scores by 1. At 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th tier you may increase one ability score of your choice by 1. As normal, you can�t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

#### Additional Hit Dice
Your ship gains 1 additional Hit Die. It gains 1 additional Hit Die at 2nd tier (2), 3rd tier (3), 4th tier (4), and 5th tier (5).

#### Additional Modifications
Your ship gains 5 additional modification slots. It gains 5 additional modification slots at 2nd tier (10), 3rd tier (15), 4th tier (20), and 5th tier (25).

### Superior Firepower
Also at 1st tier, your starship's firepower can overwhelm larger ships.

When a deployed gunner deals damage to a Large or larger ship with a ship weapon, the gunner can increase the damage by rolling a Superior Firepower die, which is a d4, and add it to the damage roll (no action required).

Your ship's Superior Firepower die changes when it reaches certain tiers. The die becomes a d6 at 2nd tier, a d8 at 3rd tier, a d10 at 4th tier, and a d12 at 5th tier.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 5 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | STARSHIPS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship 
Your ship gains the Emergency Generator and Power Backup modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ships shields extend further around it. Whenever a friendly ship would take damage while within 250 feet of your ship, if the source of that damage is more than 250 feet away for your ship and your ship's shields are active, they instead take that damage. If the damage reduces your shield to 0, the protected ship takes any remaining damage.

#### Command Ship
Your ship gains the Command Center suite and Scanner modifications, which do not count against its total modifications or suite systems. Additionally, when a coordinator deployed in a command center takes the Direct action, the target of the Direct action can reroll one of the dice once.

#### Warship
Your ship gains two Fixed Hardpoint modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, your ship has a +1 bonus to damage rolls with ship weapons.

### Prime Doctrine
Also at 2nd tier, your starship strikes fear in your enemies. When a deployed coordinator rolls initiative, they can attempt to frighten other ships. Each crew member deployed on a hostile ship must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + the coordinator's proficiency bonus + their Charisma modifier). On a failed save, affected crew members have disadvantage on the first ability check, attack roll, or saving throw they make each round for 1 minute. At the end of each of their turns, they repeat this save, ending this effect on a success. Additionally, on a successful save, they become immune to this feature for one day.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Versatile Dreadnought
Starting at 3rd tier, when a deployed crew member makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they can use their reaction to have advantage on the roll. A deployed crew member can choose to use this feature after they make their roll, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to<br> 5 x your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Superweapon
Also at 3rd tier, your ship is equipped with a superweapon. As an action, a deployed operator can activate the superweapon, which has a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. When activated, a beam of destructive energy forming a line 10,000 feet long and 100 feet wide blasts from the weapon. Each ship in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship takes 10d10 energy damage, or half as much on a successful one.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Blockade Ship
The protective radius of your ship's shields increases to 500 feet, and your shield regeneration rate doubles.

#### Command Ship
A deployed coordinator can, as an action, issue an order to a Huge or smaller ship. That ship can immediately move up to its flying speed, and up to five deployed crew members on that ship can use their reaction to immediately take an action.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

#### Warship
When a deployed gunner on your ship rolls the maximum on a damage die for a ship weapon, they can roll an additional die.

### Citadel
Also at 4th tier, the capacity for all of your suites is doubled. Additionally, your starship's maximum capacity for fuel and consumables doubles, and civilians, crew members, and troopers aboard your starship have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to avoid Exhaustion.

### Paragon Dreadnought
As of 5th tier, your starship is a the best in its class. Two of your ship's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (your choice) increase by 4, and the other ability score increases by 2. Its maximum for the chosen scores increases by 4, and for the other ability score by 2.

### Devastator
Also at 5th tier, as an action, a deployed crew member can give the ship the following benefits for 1 minute:
- Your ship has resistance to all damage.
- Your ship's ship attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

This effect ends early if the ship is disabled. Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

## Variant: Space Stations
Players may decide they want to invest in a space station. Only size categories Large and larger are appropriate for space stations. If players elect to own a space station instead of�or in addition to�a starship, use the following rules. 

#### Armor Class
When calculating a space station's armor class, use the operator's Technology instead of of the pilot's Piloting, by taking the station's size base armor class (as shown in the Starship Size Base Armor Class table on page 56), add the deployed operator's Intelligence (Technology) modifier, and any applicable bonuses. For example, a Large station has a base armor class of 7. If the operator has an Intelligence of 16, a proficiency bonus of +2, proficiency in Technology, and the station is using deflection armor, his station has an armor class of 12. You do not require proficiency in Technology to attempt to operate a space station.

#### Stock Modifications
Your space station comes with the Central Computer universal system in addition to the other stock modifications.

#### Flying Speed and Turning Speed
The station's flying speed become 50 feet and it's turning speed becomes 100 feet, regardless of any bonuses or penalties. The station's flying speed and turning speed can never be increased or decreased.

#### Hit Points Per Hit Die
For each Hit Die a space station has, it gains 2 additional hit points.

#### Hyperspace Travel
Your travel time in hyperspace is doubled.

#### Modification Slots at Tier 0
The modification slots at tier 0 doubles. For instance, while a Large ship has 15 modification slots at tier 0, a Large station instead has 30 modification slots.

#### Starship Size Maximum Suites
The maximum number of suites a station can have (as shown in the Starship Size Maximum Suites table on page 43) doubles. For instance, while a Large ship has a maximum of 8 suites, a Large station instead has a maximum of 16 suites.

\columnbreak

## Space Station Tier Features
When players upgrade a space station to certain tier levels, they can choose from the following feature options, instead of those available only to starships.

### Role Specialization
At 2nd tier, you adopt a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Space Station (Large) 
Your station gains the Premium Central Computer modification, which does not count against its total modifications. Additionally, when a deployed crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their bonus to Technology checks is less than that of the station's artificial intelligence, they can instead use the artificial intelligence's bonus to Technology checks.

#### Space Station (Huge) 
Your station gains the Premium Central Computer and Enhanced Communications modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, when a deployed crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their bonus to Technology checks is less than that of the station's artificial intelligence, they can instead use the artificial intelligence's bonus to Technology checks.

#### Space Station (Gargantuan) 
Your station gains the Premium Central Computer and Improved Communications modifications, which do not count against its total modifications. Additionally, when a deployed crew member on your station has to make an Intelligence (Technology) check, if their bonus to Technology checks is less than that of the station's artificial intelligence, they can instead use the artificial intelligence's bonus to Technology checks.

### Role Mastery
At 4th tier, you master a particular style of design for your ship. Choose from the following.

#### Space Station (All Sizes)
When a deployed crew member on your station is targeted by the Interfere action, they have advantage on the Intelligence (Technology) check made to contest it. If they already have advantage, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

# Chapter 4: Modifications

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s soon as heroes get theirs hands on a starship, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they want to modify it. The desire for faster hyperdrives, more weapons, better shields, and possibly even some space for smuggled goods generally comes before the first payment to a Hutt loan shark is due. Upgrading and modifying a starship gives players a sense of ownership that makes them more connected to a campaign, and it serves other useful purposes as well.

Heroes who want to improve a starship have a built-in reason to take risks to earn credits (or other rewards, such as the use of the repair bay of a grateful military group). Although *Star Wars* focuses on on heroic action-adventure over the cobbling together of credits for tinkering with a ship, many characters are simply more motivated if they know there's a material reward on the line. Furthermore, a starship acts as a good base of operations, allowing heroes to have a place that seems like home even as they gallivant across the galaxy. Finally, as the heroes gain levels, a better-equipped ship prepares them for greater challenges.

## Modifying a Starship
When ships are produced, they are left with a certain amount of extra space, superstructure and power consumption leftover
to facilitate the addition of new system modifications and suites. In addition to the costs associated with acquiring raw materials, components and installation, each one of these modifications consumes one of a ship's modification slots. This section details all of the system modifications available to a ship. There are five categories of modifications:
- **Engineering**: These systems aid in mechanical function of the ship.
- **Operation**: These systems aid in operations and response function of the ship.
- **Suite**: These systems add population-based functionality to the ship.
- **Universal**: These systems passively augment the ship.
- **Weapon**: These systems add new weapon mounts, or improve existing ones.

When players acquire a new ship, it typically comes with minimal modifications already installed. Players then choose the modifications they want installed on their ship. Like construction and upgrading, installing new systems and modifying old ones takes materials, time, and a substantial workforce. Even with the requisite components, the GM may decide that a modification is inaccessible; it might only be obtainable if the heroes get hold of it directly, by recovering it from a supply depot, trading it off of a collector, or stealing it from the manufacturer. 

\columnbreak

The cost of a modification depends on the category from which it comes, as shown below in the Modification Category Cost table.

#### Modification Category Base Cost
| Modification Category | Base Cost |
|:----|----:|
| Engineering  | 3,500 cr |
| Operation | 3,500 cr |
| Suite | 5,000 cr |
| Universal | 4,000 cr |
| Weapon | 3,000 cr |

### Cost Modifiers
In the same way it costs more to upgrade a capital ship than a starfighter, it costs more to modify it as well. Each starship has a cost modifier depending on the ship's size, as shown in the Starship Size Modification Cost table below:

#### Starship Size Modification Cost
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 5 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 50 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 500 |

For instance, to purchase and install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, it costs 3,000 credits. To purchase and install one on a Huge ship, however, it costs 150,000 (3,000 x 50).

### Modification Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to perform modifications. For a Small ship, two people can do everything necessary (though additional staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Modification Workforce table.

#### Starship Size Modification Workforce
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 2 |
| Medium  | 4 |
| Large  | 10 |
| Huge | 100 |
| Gargantuan | 1,000 |

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Modification Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter can be modified in no more than a week's time. However, a new modification layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to modify a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("modification category base cost" x "starship size modification cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install a Fixed Hardpoint in a Small ship, with a workforce of 2, it takes three days. To install one on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, it also takes 3 days.

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

### Modification Tier Requirements
Finally, some modifications have a ship tier requirement. These modifications are more costly, using scarce materials to construct and install. When purchasing and installing a modification with a tier requirement, multiply the final cost of the modification by the modification's tier requirement.

Additionally, these modifications require more precise skill to install. When making a modification, the foremost mechanic must make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check to correctly install these modifications. The DC for the check varies based on the tier requirement of the modification, as shown below in the Modification Tier Requirement DC table below.

#### Modification Tier Requirement DC
| Modification Tier Requirement| DC |
|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | 10 |
| 2 | 15 |
| 3 | 20 |
| 4 | 25 |
| 5 | 30 |

On a failure, half the requisite time and cost is incurred, but the modification is not installed.

### Prerequisites
Some modifications have prerequisites that must be met before they can be installed. If you are installing two or more modifications at the same time, you can install a modification at the same time that you install its prerequisite. If the modification has a tier requirement, you can't install that modification until your ship reaches that tier.

If at any time you lose access to a modification's prerequisite, such as removal or ship damage, you can't use that modification again until you regain access to the prerequisite.

\columnbreak

### Changing Saving Throw Proficiency
When a starship is created, a saving throw proficiency is chosen from a list available to the starship. Later on, however, players may want to change their starship's saving throw proficiency to another of the available options. Changing a saving throw proficiency requires time and credits as if installing a new universal modification.

### Removing Modifications
Sometimes, characters might decide they want to remove a modification in favor of a new one. Removing a modification requires half the cost it takes to install the modification originally, and takes half the time.

If replacing the modification at the same time as removal, the cost to remove is incurred, but the additional time to remove is not required.

### Starship Tier Features
If a modification is granted to your starship by a starship tier feature, such as the Role Specialization feature, that modification does not count against its total modifications, comes at no additional cost, and you can't voluntarily remove it. If your starship already has that modification, you may install an additional modification that is available to you.

### Modification Slots at  Tier 0
At tier 0, each ship comes with a number of vacant modification slots, depending on their size:
| Starship Size | Modification Slots |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 2 |
| Small  | 5 |
| Medium  | 10 |
| Large  | 15 |
| Huge | 20 |
| Gargantuan | 25 |

### Stock Modifications
Also at tier 0, each ship comes with the following modifications, at no additional cost, which do not count against its total modifications or suite systems.
- **Tiny:** Droid Brain.
- **Small:** One Fixed Hardpoint.
- **Medium:** Hyperdrive Slot, and your choice of one Barracks, Living Quarters, or Luxury Quarters suite.
- **Large:** Hyperdrive Slot, Navcomputer Slot, and your choice of two Barracks, Living Quarters, or Luxury Quarters suites.
- **Huge:** Enhanced Scanner, Hyperdrive Slot, Navcomputer Slot, Escape Pod suite, and your choice of four Barracks, Living Quarters, or Luxury Quarters suites.
- **Gargantuan:** Emergency Generator, Enhanced Communications, Enhanced Scanner, Hyperdrive Slot, Navcomputer Slot, Surge Protector, Docking Bay and Escape Pod suites, and your choice of eight Barracks, Living Quarters, or Luxury Quarters suites.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Engineering Systems
These modifications offer unique functionality to the ship. Each engineering system can be chosen multiple times.

Certain engineering systems mention a deployed mechanic's proficiency bonus. In order to add your proficiency bonus to these features, you must be proficient in Mechanic's Kits.

### Alternative Fuel Converter
Your ship is equipped with an alternative fuel converter which allows the conversion of materials to a potential fuel source. Over the course of 10 minutes, a deployed mechanic can make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check (DC  = 10 or half the number of days since the ship's last refueling, whichever number is higher). On a success, the ship recovers one day's worth of fuel.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Boarding Harpoon
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Shock Absorbers_<br>
Your ship has been further modified with a massive grappling harpoon, through which creatures can pass. When a deployed pilot takes the Ram action, and the target fails the saving throw, they become harpooned. While harpooned, the target ship's flying speed is reduced to 0, and your ship's flying speed is reduced by half. Your ship's pilot can release the harpooned ship at any time (no action required). The harpooned ship is automatically released if your ship becomes disabled, or if it is forcefully moved more than 100 feet away from your ship.

***Removing the Harpoon.*** A harpooned ship's pilot can use its action to make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the deployed mechanic's proficiency bonus + your ship's Strength modifier), ending the effect on a success.

***Moving a Harpooned Ship.*** When your ship moves, it can drag the harpooned ship with it, unless the ship is larger than your ship.

***Boarding a Harpooned Ship.*** While the ship is harpooned, up to six creatures of Medium size or smaller can move through the gap onto the harpooned ship each round.

***Recovering the Harpoon.*** Recovering and reinstalling the harpoon takes 1 minute.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Countermeasures
This modification adds a series of countermeasures to the ship, granting it a more active approach to ward off effects. Once per round, when your ship is forced to make a saving throw against an effect that would cause it to be blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, or stunned, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to add their Intelligence modifier to the roll (minimum of +1).

### Emergency Generator
Your ship is equipped with an emergency generator to recharge shields. When your ship is reduced to 0 shield points but not destroyed outright, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 shield point instead. Alternatively, if the ship has 0 shield points, a deployed mechanic can use their action to restore shield points equal to twice their Intelligence modifier. 

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Feedback Shield
Your ship's shield is enhanced to reflect damage to would-be attackers. As a reaction to the ship being hit with a primary or secondary weapon, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to deal damage to the attacking ship. The damage depends on your ship's size: 1d4 for a Tiny ship, 1d6 for a Small ship, 1d8 for a Medium ship, 1d10 for a Large ship, 1d12 for a Huge ship, or 1d20 for a Gargantuan ship. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the start of the deployed mechanic's next turn.

<div class='footnote'>PART 1 | MODIFICATIONS</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Flare Pods
Your ship is a equipped with a series of counter-measure flares. When your ship is forced to make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to release a flare. When they do so, your ship has advantage on the triggering saving throw. The deployed mechanic can choose to use this feature after the roll is made, but before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. If they already have advantage on the saving throw, they can instead reroll one of the dice once.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier (a minimum of once). All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Improved Countermeasures
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
_Prerequisite: Countermeasures_<br>
This modification enhances your ship's countermeasures, allowing it to quickly clear lingering effects. As an action, a deployed operator can activate this feature, ending the blinded, ionized, shocked, stalled, and stunned conditions.

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Interdiction Drive
_Prerequisite: Tier 1_<br>
You unlock an interdiction drive in your ship, which can be activated to impede ships around it. As an action, a deployed mechanic can engage the interdiction drive. Each ship within 100 feet of your ship must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the mechanic's proficiency bonus + your ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship's flying speed is reduced by 100 feet and its turning speed is increased by 50 feet until the end of the mechanic's next turn.

If a ship is two or more sizes larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it is two or more sizes smaller, it instead has disadvantage. 

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Invulnerability Drive
_Prerequisite: Tier 3_<br>
Your ship is equipped with an experimental device which can render it immune to all damage. As an action, a deployed mechanic can activate the drive. Once activated, the drive lasts for 1d4 rounds, granting the following benefits:
- Your ship is immune to all damage.
- Your ship's flying speed is reduced by half.
- Your ship's turning speed is doubled.

A deployed mechanic can end this effect at any time, no action required. When the effect ends, the deployed mechanic must make a Destruction saving throw. On a failure, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Nano-Droid Distributor
Your ship is equipped with a nano-droid distributor that allows it to repair other ships. When a deployed mechanic takes the Patch action, they can instead repair another ship within 100 feet. You spend and roll one of your ship's Hit Dice, and the tar ship regains that many hit points.

### Power Backup
Your ship is equipped with a back up battery, which can give it renewed energy. When your ship is reduced to 0 hit points but not destroyed outright, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to have it drop to 1 hit point instead. Alternatively, if the ship is making Destruction saving throws, a deployed mechanic can use their action to automatically succeed on a Destruction saving throw.

Once either feature has been used, the power backup can't be used again until the ship undergoes maintenance.

### Self-Destruct Mechanism
Your ship is equipped with a self-destruct mechanism that can cause immense destruction at the expense of the ship. A deployed mechanic can activate the self-destruct mechanism as an action, setting a timer up to 10 minutes in length. When the timer expires, the ship explodes, dealing thermite damage to each enemy within range. The damage is calculated as follows; for each Hit Die the ship has, roll it and add the ship's Strength modifier to the roll. 

The range that the self-destruct mechanism impacts varies, depending on the ship's size:
- **Tiny**: A Tiny ship deals damage to each ship within 50 feet of it.
- **Small**: A Small ship deals damage to each ship within 100 feet of it.
- **Medium**: A Medium ship deals damage to each ship within 200 feet of it.
- **Large**: A Large ship deals damage to each ship within 400 feet of it.
- **Huge**: A Huge ship deals damage to each ship within 1,000 feet of it.
- **Gargantuan**: A Gargantuan ship deals damage to each ship within 2,000 feet of it.

### Shield Bleedthrough
_Prerequisite: Tier 2_<br>
Your ship's reactor is overhauled to give temporary boosts to your ship's weapon batteries. When your ship hits another ship with a primary or secondary weapon attack while it still has shield points, a deployed mechanic can use their reaction to cause some of the damage to bleed through. The damage the ship's shields take is reduced by an amount equal to your ship's Strength modifier. The ship's hull then takes this much damage. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage.

Once this feature has been used, it can't be used again until the start of the deployed mechanic's next turn.

\columnbreak

### Shock Absorbers
_Prerequisite: Ship size Medium or larger_<br>

Additionally, when your ship sends out communications, those communications can be encrypted, only understandable by recipients with the cipher. A deployed operator can encrypt communications by making an Intelligence (Technology) check, setting the decrypt DC. Another deployed operator can spend 1 minute attempting to decode the encrypted communications by making an Intelligence check against the decrypt DC. On a success, they decrypt the message. On a failure, they do not decrypt your encrypted message, and can't attempt to do so again for one day. 

Lastly, when another ship tries to suppress your communications, the deployed operator has advantage on the Intelligence (Technology) check made to contest it.

### Improved Scanner

The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship's shield capacity and shield regeneration rate are reduced by half for 1 minute. If the ship's current shield points would exceed the new shield capacity, they are reduced accordingly. At the start of each of the target ship's pilot's turns it repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is targeted by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If tractored by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

You can end the shield disruptor at any time (no action required).

This feature can be used a number of times equal to your ship's tier. All expended uses are regained when the ship undergoes maintenance.

\columnbreak

### Tractor Beam
This modification adds a tractor beam to a ship, which can be used to grasp and guide vessels and debris. A deployed operator can activate the tractor beam as an action, which has a range of 1,000 feet and a limited firing arc, as described in Chapter 9. Each ship within the firing arc must make a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + the operator's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, a ship is tractored for 1 minute and immediately gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship's orientation. At the start of each of a tractored ship's pilot's turns, a tractored ship gets pulled 100 feet towards the tractoring ship, without changing the ship's orientation, and then repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

If a ship is tractored by a ship two or more sizes larger than them, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If tractored by a ship two or more sizes smaller, it instead has advantage.

If you are attempting to tractor a ship larger than you, and the ship succeeds on the saving throw, you can instead use the tractor beam to tractor yourself to the ship, gaining the tractored condition.

You can end the tractor beam at any time (no action required).

### Supercharger Station
This suite comes with a number of separate unique stations equal to one-fourth the ship's suite capacity by size, as shown in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table. When a techcaster completes a long rest involving this suite, as long as they have their techcasting focus, they gain temporary tech points equal to their tech power maximum power level + their Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). When you cast a tech power while you have temporary tech points, the temporary tech points are spent first. All temporary tech points are lost at the end of your next long rest.

### Transportation
This suite offers a single room, or series of rooms, typically located near the cockpit, featuring a number of seats and individual storage, as well as communal refresher stations (one for every 16 seats), to transport a number of civilians, crew members, or troopers equal to four times the ship's suite capacity by size, as shown in the Starship Size Suite Capacity table.

\columnbreak

### Vault
This suite comes equipped with a vault, which has a capacity equal to half your ship's base cargo capacity, as shown in the Starship Size Cargo Capacity table on page 55. The vault is equipped with both a key and a code lock, and is magnetically sealed to prevent it opening in the event of power failure. The vault can be accessed with a DC 25 Intelligence (Security Kit) check. When the vault is accessed, an alarm sounds in the Bridge and Security Suite (if it exists). If a player rolls a 30 or higher on the Intelligence (Security Kit) check to unlock the vault, or has the key or code, the alarm can be bypassed.

### Workshop
This suite offers a crafting station with each set of artisan's tools integrated. While crafting at the crafting station, you can add your proficiency bonus to checks you make if you do not already do so. If you already add your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add double your proficiency bonus. If you already double your proficiency bonus to checks you make, you instead add half of your governing ability modifier (rounded down, minimum of +1), in addition to your ability modifier.

Additionally, while crafting at a crafting station, the total market value you can craft per day increases by an amount of credits equal to 5 x your character level. If you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with them, the market value increases by 10 x your character level.

## Weapon Systems
These modifications deal with the installation and improvement of weapon systems. Each weapon system can be chosen multiple times.

Certain weapon systems mention a deployed gunner's proficiency bonus. In order to add your proficiency bonus to these features, you must be proficient with ship weapons.

### Blinding Rounds
_Prerequisite: Weapon that deals thermite damage_<br>
When you have advantage on the attack roll and hit, and the lower of the two d20 rolls would also hit, or when the target ship has disadvantage on the saving throw and fails, and the higher of the two rolls would also fail, you can force the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, the ship is blinded until the start of your next turn.

If the damaged ship is larger than your ship, it has advantage on the saving throw. If the damaged ship is smaller than your ship, it instead has disadvantage.

### Direct Controller
_Prerequisite: Primary or Secondary Weapon_<br>
The deployed gunner can use their Dexterity modifier instead of the ship's for the attack and damage rolls of the chosen weapon.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Expanded Payload
_Prerequisite: Tertiary or Quaternary Weapon_<br>
The reload value of the chosen weapon increases by half.

### Explosive Payload
_Prerequisite: Tertiary or Quaternary Weapon_<br>
When a ship fails a saving throw against the chosen weapon and another ship is within 50 feet of it, the second ship must also make the saving throw. On a failed save, the second ship takes damage equal to your ship's Dexterity modifier. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.

### Fixed Hardpoint
A fixed hardpoint is used to mount a primary, secondary, or tertiary weapon. A weapon mounted on a fixed hardpoint has a limited firing arc, as described in chapter 9. 

### Full Salvo Protocol

# Chapter 5: Equipment

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he starship marketplace on the planet of Kuat <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;teems with a myriad of manufacturers trying to peddle their parts. Santhe engineers preach the benefits of their lightweight ship armors, while Czerka employees counter that reinforcement trumps speed. SoroSuub representatives propagate the destructive power of their heavy laser cannon across from BlasTech vendors demonstrating their rapid-fire laser cannon, which they tote as more consistent. Across this planet, and many others, ships and parts for myriad vessels are available for purchase.

This chapter offers choices of certain equipment types, to be used in conjunction with the starship upgrades featured in Chapter 4. The listed prices are those appropriate to ships of a Small size; when outfitting a ship of any other size, you'll want to apply the starship size equipment cost, as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Cost table below, which differs slightly from a similar table found in Chapter 4.

### Cost Modifiers
It costs more to purchase a primary weapon for a capital ship than one for a starfighter; parts for bigger starships are simply costlier to acquire and install. Consequently, each starship has a cost modifier, derived from its size as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Cost table below, which is multiplied by the base cost of the item.

#### Starship Size Equipment Cost 
| Starship Size | Cost Modifier |
|:----:|:-------------|
| Tiny  |&emsp;&emsp;x 0.5 |
| Small |&emsp;&emsp;x 1 |
| Medium |&emsp;&emsp;x 2 |
| Large |&emsp;&emsp;x 5 |
| Huge |&emsp;&emsp;x 50 |
| Gargantuan |&emsp;&emsp;x 500 |

For instance, to purchase and install Deflection Armor on a Small size ship, it costs 3,100 credits. To purchase and install it on a Huge ship, however, it costs 155,000 (3,100 x 50).

> For weapons, follow the Weapons by Size information. The math is the same, just simplified since weapons use two tables.

### Equipment Workforce
Additionally, bigger ships require more people to install new equipment. For a Small ship, a single person can do everything necessary (though additionally staff will reduce the time taken), while a Medium or larger ship requires a more extensive workforce, as shown below in the Starship Size Equipment Workforce table below.

\columnbreak

#### Starship Size Equipment Workforce 
| Starship Size | Minimum Workforce |
|:----:|:----:|
| Tiny  | 1 |
| Small  | 1 |
| Medium  | 2 |
| Large  | 5 |
| Huge | 50 |
| Gargantuan | 500 |

### Installation Time
With sufficient workforce, a snubfighter's equipment can be installed in no more than a week's time. However, installing a new equipment layout in a freighter can take up to a month, and an overhaul of a large ship such as a cruiser might take a year. It isn't practical for a smaller workforce to make changes to such big ships, regardless of how much time the workers have.

The base time needed to upgrade a starship is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**time (in days) = ("base cost of new equipment" x "starship size equipment cost") / (500 x "size of workforce")**

</div>

___

For instance, to install Deflection Armor in a Small ship, with a workforce of 1, would take 6.2 days. To install it on a Huge ship, with a workforce of 100, however, would take 3.1 days [(3,100 x 50) / (500 x 100)].

It is assumed that each member of the workforce works 8 hours per day.

## Cargo
One of the primary features of a starship is its ability to store and transport cargo. This capacity accounts for everything not directly mounted to the ship, such as consumables, extra fuel, and personnel.

### Cargo Capacity
Each ship comes with a capacity for a certain amount of cargo, depending on its size, as shown below in the Starship Size Cargo Capacity table.

#### Starship Size Cargo Capacity
|Starship Size|Cargo Capacity&emsp;&emsp;|
|:--:|--:|
|Tiny|�&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;|
|Small|2 tons&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|Medium|25 tons&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|Large|500 tons&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|Huge|10,000 tons&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|
|Gargantuan|200,000 tons&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|

## Armor and Shields
Different ships use different types of armor based on their size and maneuverability. Snubfighters typically use lighter weight armor giving them greater avoidance, while bombers focus more on absorption over maneuverability. In addition to armor, some ships have shields to give them a greater defensive advantage.

### Armor
Armor augments the Armor Class and hit points of a ship. All starships have access to armor without need of modifications.

#### Armor Class
The armor class of a ship is determined by taking the ship's size base armor class (as shown in the Starship Size Base Armor Class table below), adding the pilot's Intelligence (Piloting) modifier, and any applicable bonuses to it. For example, a Small ship has a base armor class of 9. If the pilot has an Intelligence of 16, a proficiency bonus of +2, proficiency in Piloting, and the ship is using deflection armor, his ship has an armor class of 14. You do not require proficiency in Piloting to attempt to fly a space ship.

#### Starship Size Base Armor Class
|Starship Size|Base Armor Class|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|10|
|Small|9|
|Medium|8|
|Large|7|
|Huge|6|
|Gargantuan|5|

#### Deflection Armor
Deflection armor is the most common type of armor aboard ships, and offers no benefit or penalty to armor class or hit points.

#### Lightweight Armor
Lightweight armor offers a trade-off of a more maneuverable but less resilient ship. A ship with Lightweight Armor installed has a +1 bonus to armor class, but has one fewer maximum hit point per Hit Die. 

<br>

<div style='margin-top:14px'></div>

#### Reinforced Armor
Opposite of lightweight armor is reinforced armor. This armor improves a ship's resilience, but makes it less likely to avoid damage. A ship with Reinforced Armor installed has a -1 penalty to armor class, but has one additional maximum hit point per Hit Die.

### Shields
Some ships (like TIE Fighters) lack shields, though most ships have them. Shields determine a ships shield points and shield regeneration rate. Shield points determine how strong a ship's shields are, while shield regeneration rate determines how quickly those shields regenerate.  All starships have access to shields without need of modifications.

***Shield Capacity.*** The capacity of shields is calculated by multiplying the ship's hit points by the shield capacity. For instance, if a ship has 50 hit points, then it would have 50 shield points with a Directional Shield, but only 25 with a Quick-Charge Shield.

***Shield Regeneration Rate.*** Shield regeneration rate is represented by a value, and the shields regenerate by that amount at the start of the pilot's turn. The shield regeneration rate is calculated by multiplying the maximum value of the ship's Hit Die by the shield regeneration rate coefficient. For instance, a Small ship regenerates 6 shield points at the start of the pilot's turn with a Direction Shield, but only 3 shield points with a Fortress Shield (6 x 50%).

***Shield Depletion.*** In the event that shield points are reduced to 0, they no longer regenerate until your ship undergoes maintenance.

#### Directional Shield
Directional Shields are the most commonly used and balanced shields on the market.

#### Fortress Shield
Fortress shields offer a higher maximum shield points, but regenerate slower than normal shields.

#### Quick-Charge Shield
Quick-Charge Shields, opposite of Fortress Shields, offer a reduced capacity, but rapidly replenish.

## Weapons
Ships have a weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret hardpoint modification.

Ship weapons are divided into four categories: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Properties vary based on the weapon's category.

#### Primary Weapons
Primary weapons are the most common type that ships carry: laser cannons. If a ship has any weapons, it has laser cannons. Laser cannons vary in accuracy, effective range, rate of fire, damage, and damage type.

In a Large or larger ship, rather than an attack roll, primary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

#### Secondary Weapons
Secondary weapons are typically railguns. These weapons deal more damage and have a longer range than primary weapons, but they are more cumbersome and have a slower rate of fire. They are a common addition to gunships. 

In a Large or larger ship, rather than an attack roll, secondary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

#### Tertiary Weapons
Tertiary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of missiles, rockets or torpedoes. These weapons have a long range, high accuracy, and massive damage potential but they are limited use and expensive to obtain. X-Wings are typically outfitted with proton torpedoes. 

Rather than attack rolls, tertiary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

#### Quaternary Weapons
Quaternary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of bombs, charges, and mines. These weapons deal massive damage, but travel at slow speeds, and costly to maintain. Y-Wings are typically outfitted with proton bombs.

Rather than attack rolls, quaternary weapons call for saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

&emsp;When released, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving at the start of the firing gunner's turn. Quaternary weapons detonate when they physically connect with an object, when the firing gunner detonates them remotely using their reaction, or 1 minute after they are deployed.

When a deployed gunner takes the Attack action with a quaternary weapon, they can release multiple loaded ammunition simultaneously. If they choose to do so, the ammunition travels in the same space at the same velocity and can be detonated as a part of the same reaction. 

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. 

Weapons with the ammunition property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range property varies based on the weapon type.

***Tertiary Weapons.***  The first number is the tertiary weapon�s **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the tertiary weapon�s **long range**. When attacking a target with a tertiary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can�t attack a target beyond the tertiary weapon�s **long range**.

***Quaternary Weapons.*** Quaternary weapons do not have a range. Instead, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round.

#### Attack Bonus
Some weapons come with an attack bonus. When a deployed gunner makes an attack roll with a weapon with an attack bonus, they add the bonus (or subtract, if negative) to the attack roll.

If a tertiary or quaternary weapon has an attack bonus, they add the bonus (or subtract, if negative) to the weapon's save DC.

#### Attacks Per Round
The rate at which weapons fire varies based on weapon. The "Attacks per Round" column shows how many ship attacks a deployed gunner can make with the chosen weapon when they take the Attack action.

\pagebreakNum

#### Power
You can use a weapon that has the power property to make a ranged attack without the use of ammunition. The weapon draws directly from the ship's power source.

Weapons with the power property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range lists two numbers. The effect of these two numbers varies based on the weapon type.

***Primary Weapons.*** The first number is the primary weapon�s **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the primary weapon�s **long range**. When attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. In a Large or larger ship, when attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can�t attack a target beyond the weapon�s **long range**. 

***Secondary Weapons.*** The first number is the secondary weapon�s **close range** in feet, and the second number indicates the secondary weapon�s **normal range**. When attacking a target within **close range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. When attacking a target beyond **close range**, but within **normal range**, you make the attack roll unaltered. In a Large or larger ship, when attacking a target within **close range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. When attacking a target beyond **close range**, but within **normal range**, they make the saving throw unaltered. You can�t attack a target beyond the secondary weapon�s **normal range**. 

#### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A deployed crew member must then reload it. Reloading a weapon takes 1 minute per ammunition.

## Weapons by Size
In addition to the cost of the weapon varying by size, the damage dice vary as well. There are two tables. The first is for size Tiny to Medium ships, and the second is for size Large to Gargantuan.

### Tiny to Medium
On the Ship Weapons (Small) table, the shown values for appropriate for Small size ships. When scaling these weapons to size Tiny or Medium ships, there are steps that vary based on weapon type.

#### Primary and Secondary Weapons
When scaling a primary or secondary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the damage die by one step. When scaling a primary or secondary weapon to a size Medium ship, increase the damage die by one step. 

For instance, a Laser Cannon for a size Tiny ship deals 1d4 energy damage; for a size Medium ship it deals 1d8 energy damage. Meanwhile, a Slug Railgun for a size Tiny ship deals 2d6 kinetic damage; for a size Medium ship it deals 2d10 kinetic damage.

\columnbreak

#### Tertiary and Quaternary Weapons
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the damage die by one step and reduce the reload number by half. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Medium ship, increase the damage die by one step and double the reload number. 

For instance, a Cluster Missile Launcher for a size Tiny ship deals 2d8 energy damage and has a reload of 4; for a size Medium ship it deals 2d12 energy damage and has a reload of 16. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 2, while a Bomblet costs deals 3d8 energy damage; for a size Medium ship the Bomb Deployer has a reload of 8, while a Bomblet deals 3d12 energy damage.

### Large to Gargantuan
On the Ship Weapons (Huge) table, the shown values for appropriate for Huge size ships. When scaling these weapons to size Large or Gargantuan ships, there are steps that vary based on weapon type.

#### Primary and Secondary Weapons
When scaling a primary or secondary weapon to a size Large ship, reduce the damage die by one step. When scaling a primary or secondary weapon to a size Gargantuan ship, increase the damage die by one step. 

For instance, a Laser Battery for a size Large ship deals 2d4 energy damage; for a size Gargantuan ship it deals 2d8 energy damage. Meanwhile, a Heavy Slug Railgun for a size Large ship deals 4d6 kinetic damage; for a size Medium ship it deals 4d10 kinetic damage.

#### Tertiary and Quaternary Weapons
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Large ship,  reduce the damage die by one step and reduce the reload number by half. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Gargantuan ship, increase the damage die by one step and double the reload number. 

For instance, a Cluster Missile Array for a size Large ship deals 4d8 energy damage and has a reload of 32; for a size Gargantuan ship it deals 4d12 energy damage and has a reload of 128. Meanwhile, a Bomb Layer for a size Large ship has a reload of 16, while a Bomblet deals 6d8 energy damage; for a size Gargantuan ship the Bomb Deployer has a reload of 64, while a Bomblet deals 6d12 energy damage.

## Ammunition 
Tertiary and quaternary weapons require ammunition. The cost associated is for each individual unit.

### Tertiary Ammunition
The ammunition for tertiary weapons varies based on the specific type of launcher attached to the hardpoint.

### Quaternary Ammunition
The ammunition for quaternary weapons, while fire-able by the same bomb deployer, vary greatly in function. Regardless of their function, all quaternary ammunition has 1 hit point and an AC of 20. Upon destruction, all quaternary ammunition detonates. The damage value is appropriate for Small ships, while the value in parentheses is appropriate for Huge ships. For other ship sizes, scale the cost and die by reducing or increasing it, as explained in "Weapons by Size".

#### Bomblets
When a bomblet detonates, each ship within 100 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A ship takes 3d10 (6d10) energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### EMP Bomb
When an EMP bomb detonates, each ship within 200 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

#### Proximity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, proximity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a proximity mine detonates, each ship within 100 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A ship takes 2d10 (4d10) thermite damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Pulse Bomb
When an pulse bomb detonates, each ship within 200 feet must make a Constitution saving throw. A ship takes 2d10 (4d10) pulse damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, if the ship is your size or smaller, it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a deployed mechanic can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

#### Seismic Charge
When a seismic charge detonates, each ship within 300 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A ship takes 1d10 (2d10) kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

## Hyperdrive
The hyperdrive is a propulsion system that allows a starship to reach lightspeed and traverse the void between stars in the alternate dimension of hyperspace. For a starship to have a hyperdrive, it must have a vacant hyperdrive slot modification.

The hyperdrive functions by sending hypermatter particles to hurl a ship into hyperspace while<br> preserving the vessel's mass/energy profile, and<br> requires a functional hyperdrive motivator to do so.<br> The vessel then travels along a programmed course<br> until it drops back into normal space�realspace�at its<br> destination.

A deployed operator can engage the hyperdrive as an action, after which it takes 1 minute to boot up. During that time, if the ship takes damage, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher). On a failed save, the hyperdrive fails to boot. If the ship takes damage from multiple sources, it makes a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

A hyperdrive's only function is to keep a vessel in hyperspace, and should a hyperdrive be forcibly deactivated or destroyed during transit, the ship will be violently pulled back into realspace.

Tiny ships never have a hyperdrive, while Small ships occasionally do. Medium and larger ships typically have a hyperdrive.

Hyperdrives are rated by a class: the lower the class, the faster the hyperdrive. A class 1 hyperdrive travels at the speed of light, while a class 2 hyperdrive travels at half the speed of light. Consequently, a class .5 hyperdrive travels at twice the speed of light.

A ship can have multiple hyperdrives. Larger ships typically have a back-up in case of failure. Only one hyperdrive can be activated at a time. Your ship must have a hyperdrive slot for each hyperdrive.

## Navcomputer
The navcomputer is a specialized computer designed to calculate hyperspace routes. For a starship to have a navcomputer, it must have a vacant navcomputer slot modification.

When a deployed operator makes an Intelligence check to calculate astrogation, if a navcomputer is present and if they are proficient in Technology, they can instead make an Intelligence (Technology) check. A deployed operator can activate the navcomputer as a bonus action.

Some navcomputers offer a bonus when calculating astrogation, as indicated by a number after the name (for instance, a Navcomputer +1 offers a +1 bonus to the check). When you make a check to calculate astrogation, you add this bonus, regardless of whether or not you are proficient in Technology.

## Docking
All starships require refueling and restocking, as well as a place to dock where they can get these services.

### Docking Fees
Docking fees vary planet-to-planet, but typically average around 20 credits per day in an average spaceport for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the Starship Size Equipment Cost table.

For Large and larger ships, docking on planet is impractical. Typically, most civilized planets will have docking station in space that the characters can dock to. Alternatively, if they don't need to refuel or restock, they can simply remain in orbit and bypass any docking fees, while the party themselves transfer to the planet's surface in a smaller transport.

#### Long Term Storage
Long-term storage is available in some locations, averaging around 200 credits per month for a Tiny or Small ship. For a Medium or larger ship, multiply the amount by the Starship Size Equipment Cost table.

Again, it is impractical for a Large or larger ship to to be stored on planet. At large shipyards, long term storage might be available.

It generally requires about eight hours to get a ship out of long-term storage and ready for flight.

## Refueling and Restocking
All ships require fuel to operate; without it, a ship is effectively disabled. In general, most starships refuel each time they put into port, and during refueling other essential ship consumables (such as water and oxygen) are restocked as well.

### Refueling
Ships consume fuel in terms of "units", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship. A ship uses a unit's worth of fuel for one day of flight in realspace or hyperspace, after one hour of flight in atmosphere, or in a single jump to lightspeed. Costs for a day's worth of fuel can be found below on the Starship Size Fuel Cost table.

#### Starship Size Fuel Cost
|Starship Size|Fuel Cost|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|25 cr/unit|
|Small|50 cr/unit|
|Medium|100 cr/unit|
|Large|1,000 cr/unit|
|Huge|10,000 cr/unit|
|Gargantuan|100,000 cr/unit|

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

&emsp;Additionally, a ship can store an amount of fuel, as determined by its size, in the Starship Size Fuel Capacity table below.

#### Starship Size Fuel Capacity
|Starship Size|Fuel Capacity|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny| 5 units|
|Small| 10 units|
|Medium| 30 units|
|Large| 300 units|
|Huge| 600 units|
|Gargantuan| 1,800 units|

#### Primary Systems
When a ship refuels, their primary systems, such as electricity and life support, are also replenished. As long the starship has fuel remaining, primary systems function. 

### Restocking
Ships store food and beverage in terms of "portions", the quantity of which varies by the size of the ship. Each living creature aboard a ship consumes one portion per day spent aboard the ship. A portion costs 10 credits. 

#### Starship Size Food Capacity
|Starship Size|Food Capacity|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny| �|
|Small| 10 portions|
|Medium| 120 portions|
|Large| 240,000 portions|
|Huge| 9,600,000 portions|
|Gargantuan| 576,000,000 portions|

# Chapter 6: Customization Options

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/PqYzVdr.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he combination of your character's personal  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; features, as well as their chosen deployment, defines your character�s capabilities in the space component of the game, and the personal details you create set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class, species, and deployment specialization you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But this chapter is for players who want to go a step further.

This chapter defines two sets of rules for customizing your character: multispeccing and ventures. Multispeccing lets you combine deployments together, and ventures are special options you can choose as you gain ranks.

Ships are locked to their respective size-driven tiers and have no multiclass parallels.

## Multispecializing
Multispecializing allows you to gain ranks in multiple deployment specializations. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those deployments to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard specialization options.

With this rule, you have the option of gaining a rank in a new specialization whenever you advance in rank, instead of gaining a rank in your current specialization. Your ranks in all your deployments are added together to determine your character rank. For example, if you have two ranks in pilot and one in gunner, you�re a 3rd-rank character.

As you advance in ranks, you might primarily remain a member of your original deployment with just a single rank in another specialization, or you might change course entirely, never looking back at the deployment you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth specialization. Compared to a single-specialized character of the same rank, you�ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

><br>
>
>#### Multispecializing Example
> 
>Drew is playing a 1st-rank pilot. When his character is ready to progress to 2nd rank, Drew decides that his character will multispec instead of continuing to progress as a pilot. Drew�s character has been spending a lot of time with Rickey�s gunner, and has even been doing some simulations. Drew decides that his character will multispec into the gunner deployment, and thus his character becomes a 1st-rank pilot and 1st-rank gunner (written as pilot 1/gunner 1).
> 
>When Drew�s character is ready to progress to 3rd rank, he can decide whether to add another pilot rank (becoming a pilot 2/gunner 1), another gunner rank (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 2), or a rank in a third deployment, perhaps dabbling in the inner workings of the ship (becoming a pilot 1/gunner 1/mechanic 1).
<br><br>

\columnbreak

### Prerequisites
Unlike classes, there are no requirements for multispeccing. When a player has progressed to a rank higher than 1, they can choose to multispec or focus on their primary deployment specialization, with no external requirements or considerations. 

### Milestones 
Rather than traditional experience and book-keeping, ranks should be awarded as milestones for completing a specific encounter, or obtaining certain knowledge. 

### Proficiency Bonus
Ships do not have a proficiency bonus. When a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the proficiency bonus of the deployed crew member.

> Rather than having a separate proficiency bonus for the space and ground portions of your game, your proficiency bonus for space is the same as that of the ground. 

If a deployment feature or venture allows you to forgo your proficiency bonus, you may only do so once.

#### Expertise
If you have expertise in a skill as well as a feature that lets you forgo your proficiency bonus, you can only forgo your proficiency bonus once. For instance, if you are a 5th-level, 4th-rank pilot with an 18 in Intelligence and expertise in Piloting, you add 10 to your Piloting checks (4 + 2 x 3). If you use the 4th-rank pilot feature "That's a Good Trick" to forgo your proficiency bonus, you instead add 7 for the Piloting check as a part of that Evade action (4 + 2 x 3 - 3).

\pagebreakNum

## Gunning Styles
Certain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Style. Choose from the following. You can't take a Gunning Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Cannoneer
You are skilled with laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls.

#### Railgunning
You are skilled with railguns. While you are firing a secondary weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls. 

#### Payload Delivery
You are skilled with mines, missiles, rockets, and other explosive weapons. When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.

Certain deployment features or ventures offer your choice of Gunning Mastery. Choose from the following. You can't take a Gunning Mastery option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Cannon Mastery
You are the master of laser cannons. While you are firing a primary weapon, when you take the Attack action, you can choose to fire rapidly at the expense of accuracy. Your attacks are made without the aid of your proficiency bonus, but you use your bonus action to make an additional attack, also without your proficiency bonus.

#### Railgun Mastery
You are the master of railguns. While you are firing a secondary weapon, before you make an attack, you can choose to double your proficiency bonus. If the attack hits, you reduce the damage dealt by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

#### Payload Mastery
You are the master of missiles, rockets, and other ship-board explosive weapons. While you are firing a tertiary or quaternary weapon, you can choose to reduce the DC by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. If you do, and the target fails the saving throw, they take additional damage equal to twice your proficiency bonus.

## Ventures
Ventures represent talents beyond the deployment specialization of a character. This embodies their training and experience in other aspects of their lives. At certain deployment ranks, your deployment gives you the Venture feature. You can take each venture only once, unless the venture's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a venture to take that venture. If you ever lose a venture's prerequisite, you can't use that venture again until you regain the prerequisite. For example, the Spacecasting venture requires you to be able to cast force or tech powers. If your character loses the ability to do so, you can't benefit from the Spacecasting venture until you regain the ability to cast force or tech powers.

> Ventures, and this book in general, are designed and written in such a way that they have minimal impact on the ground game. All ventures are intended to only be usable while deployed aboard a ship, even if they don't explicitly say it.

# Chapter 7: Using Ability Scores

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/SEqkLS8.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:38px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ix abilities provide a quick description of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; every ship's, and her crew�s, physical and mental<br> characteristics:<br>

___

- **Strength**, measuring the output of the ship's reactor
- **Dexterity**, measuring the maneuverability of the ship's thrusters
- **Constitution**, measuring the durability of the ship's hull
- **Intelligence**, measuring the crew's reasoning and memory 
- **Wisdom**, measuring the crew's perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring the crew's force of personality

___

Is a ship indomitable, and her crew insightful? Fast and frightening? Nimble and notorious? Ability scores define these qualities�a ship and her crew�s assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game�the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll�rely on the six ability scores. The book�s introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers
Each of a ship and her crew�s abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a ship�s modification, or the crew's training, in activities related to that ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal average, but many ships and crew members are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a ship or crew usually reaches. Some can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and capital ships can have scores as high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores.

\columnbreak

<div style='column-count:2'>

|Score|Modifier|
|:--:|:--:|
|1|-5|
|2-3|-4|
|4-5|-3|
|6-7|-2|
|8-9|-1|
|10-11|+0|
|12-13|+1|
|14-15|+2|

|Score|Modifier|
|:--:|:--:|
|16-17|+3|
|18-19|+4|
|20-21|+5|
|22-23|+6|
|24-25|+7|
|26-27|+8|
|28-29|+9|
|30|+10|

</div>

## Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or power tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don�t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.

If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the iktotchi�s Precognition trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if an iktotchi has advantage on an ability check and rolls a l and a 13, the iktotchi could use the Precognition trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or powers. The DM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Proficiency Bonus
Ships do not have a proficiency bonus. Instead, when a feature references a proficiency bonus, instead use the proficiency bonus of the character manning the relevant deployment. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws.

Your proficiency bonus can�t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn�t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don�t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying O by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.

In general, you don�t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same rules apply.

### Expertise
Certain features, such as the Expertise class feature or Ace Pilot feat, let you double your proficiency bonus with a given skill or tool proficiency, granting expertise in that skill or tool. As usual, you can only gain expertise in a skill or tool once.

## Ability Checks
An ability check ship's ability to overcome a challenge. The DM calls for an ability check when a ship, or a crew member, attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the DM decides which of the 6 abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success-the ship, or crew member, overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it�s a failure, which means the ship or crew member makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the DM.

When making an ability check that involves Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, you use the ship's score instead of your own, as dictated by logic.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Contests
Sometimes one ship's or crew member's efforts are directly opposed to another�s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to pass through a narrow gap simultaneously. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal�for example, when a ship's gravity projector tries to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That ship or crew member either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two ship tie in a contest to pass through a narrow gap, neither ship makes it. In a contest between a ship's gravity generator tries to prevent another ship from jumping to hyperspace, a tie means that the second ship fails to jump.

|Task Difficulty|DC|
|:--|:--:|
|Very easy|	5|
|Easy|	10|
|Medium|	15|
|Hard	|20|
|Very hard	|25|
|Nearly impossible|	30|

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | USING ABILITY SCORES</div>

## Using Each Ability
Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength
Strength measures the power of a ship's reactor.

#### Strength Checks
Your GM may call for Strength checks when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as trying to push through a malleable obstruction like a net.

#### Strength Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Tractor Beam, call for a Strength saving throw. When you make a Strength saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Strength modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

\pagebreakNum

#### Flying Speed
Your ship's flying speed is determined by a relationship between it's Strength and Constitution modifiers and its base flying speed, as shown below in the Starship Size Base Flying Speed table below.

#### Starship Size Base Flying Speed
|Starship Size|Base Flying Speed|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|400 ft.|
|Small|350 ft.|
|Medium|300 ft.|
|Large|250 ft.|
|Huge|200 ft.|
|Gargantuan|150 ft.|

To calculate a ship's flying speed, use the following formula:

___

<div align='center'>

**flying speed (in feet) = "starship size base flying speed" + 50 x ("Strength modifier" - "Constitution modifier")**

</div>

___

For instance, a Small ship with a Strength and Constitution modifier of +0 has a flying speed of 350 feet. A Huge ship with a Strength modifier of +4 and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, has a flying speed of 250 feet [200 + 50 x (4 - 3)].

#### Weapon Hardpoints
A ship can have a maximum number of hardpoints equal to its Strength score.

### Dexterity
Dexterity measures the maneuverability of a ship, as determined by its thrusters.

#### Dexterity Checks
Your GM may call for Dexterity checks when you undertake actions not covered by skills, such as maneuvering through a minefield.

#### Dexterity Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Point Defense System, call for a Dexterity saving throw. When you make a Dexterity saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Dexterity modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

> ##### Hiding
> When you try to hide your ship, the deployed pilot makes a Dexterity check. If they are proficient in both Stealth and Piloting, they can add their proficiency bonus to the roll.

#### Attack and Damage Rolls
You add the ship's Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ship weapon while deployed as a gunner. 

\columnbreak

#### Turning Speed
Your ship's turning speed is determined by a relationship between it's Dexterity and Constitution modifiers and its base turning speed, as shown below in the Starship Size Base Turning Speed table below.

#### Starship Size Base Turning Speed
|Starship Size|Base Turning Speed|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|300 ft.|
|Small|250 ft.|
|Medium|200 ft.|
|Large|150 ft.|
|Huge|100 ft.|
|Gargantuan|50 ft.|

To calculate a ship's flying speed, use the following formula:

___

<div align='center'>

**turning speed (in feet) = "starship size base turning speed" - 50 x ("Dexterity modifier" - "Constitution modifier")**

</div>

___

For instance, a Small ship with a Dexterity modifier of +3 and a Constitution modifier of +0 has a turning speed of 100 feet [250 - 50 x (3 - 0)]. A Huge ship with a Dexterity modifier of +0 and a Constitution modifier of +3, however, has a turning speed of 300 feet [150 - 50 x (0 - 3)].

> If your speed would be reduced to less than 50 feet, instead increase your flying speed by that amount.

### Constitution
Constitution represents the durability of a ship's hull.

#### Constitution Checks
Your GM may call for a Constitution check when you undergo interactions not covered by skills, such as overcoming the debilitating nature of an ion storm.

#### Constitution Saving Throws
Certain features, such as a Heavy Ion Cannon, call for a Constitution saving throw. When you make a Constitution saving throw, you roll a d20 and add your ship's Constitution modifier to the roll. If your ship is proficient in the saving throw, you also add the pilot's proficiency bonus to the result of the roll.

#### Hit Points
Your ship's Constitution modifier contributes to its hit points. Typically, your ship adds its Constitution modifier to each Hit Die it rolls for its hit points.

If your ship's Constitution modifier changes, its hit point maximum changes as well, as though it had the new modifier from tier 0. For instance, if your Small ship's Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2 when it reaches 1st tier, you adjust its hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for tier 0, and then roll your hit points for tier 1 using your new modifier. Additionally, If some effect lowers your ship's Constitution score so as to reduce its Constitution modifier by 1, its hit point maximum is reduced as well.

# Chapter 8: Adventuring

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/XSXXqiB.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:58px;width:39px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iving through an asteroid field, docking in a<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space port, or simply exploring the wild blue yonder, are the things that *Star Wars* adventures are made of. Your character, with the aid of their ship, might explore wild space, undertake dangerous smuggling missions, or dispatch pirate ships. And if all goes well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a new adventure.

This chapter covers the basics of adventuring in space, from the mechanics of movement to the acquisition of the ship itself. The rules for maintenance are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your characters might pursue between adventures.

Whether adventurers are exploring uncharted territories or a complicated relationship with a criminal organization, the game follows a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book�s introduction:

___

&emsp;**1. The GM describes the environment.**

**2. The players describe what they want to do.**

**3. The GM narrates the results of their actions.**

___

Typically, the GM uses a map as an outline of the adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore enclave corridors or wilderness regions.

The GM�s notes, including a key to the map, describe what the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time and the adventurers� actions determine what happens, so the GM might use a timeline or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map.

## Ship Registration
Pilots are required to register their starships with the Bureau of Ships and Services (or BoSS). Additionally, at registration, the pilot must acquire an Operating License at the cost of 1,000 credits. To be eligible for this license they must pass a written piloting test, which requires a DC 15 Intelligence (Piloting) check.

### Transponder Codes
When ships are created, they are assigned a unique signal called a transponder code. Once registered with the BoSS, this signal can be used to identify that ship using the BoSS database. The transponder code can be used to identify a ship's owner, designation, make and model, as well as any registered modifications. Additionally, a transponder code can be used to access the ship's ownership history.

The transponder code is built into the ship's sublight engines, making any attempt to remove or alter it incredibly difficult; failing an attempt could damage or destroy a ship's engines.

\columnbreak

> ##### The Bureau of Ships and Services
> The Bureau of Ships and Services (BoSS) is a long-standing, impartial, third-party galactic organization that manages all data related to the massive number of starships present in the galaxy. The BoSS has stood for thousands of years due to their ability to stay neutral in conflicts.
>
> Information on a ship's ownership and its captains certifications are kept on file at the BoSS at all times. The data is distributed to spaceports upon request, but it is an expensive and slow process. As a result of this, smaller spaceports rarely update their registries more than once a year.
>
> The security on BoSS computer systems is of the highest caliber money can buy, making it almost impossible to access without proper authorization codes.

## Communications
Starships are equipped with basic systems that allow for communication in realspace. Typically, starship communications systems are limited to contact ships and planets within the same system, although boosters and specialized radios can reach up to several light-years. Opening a channel to a willing recipient is simply a matter of pinging their ship. They will receive a notification and can respond, opening the lines of communication.

### HoloNet
The Holonet is an instantaneous communication system that allows planets to stay in contact despite the vast distances between them. A HoloNet transceiver transmits and receives information through hyperspace, allowing information to travel millions of times faster than the speed of light. Hyperwave transceivers are embedded at strategic locations, constantly relaying information throughout the galaxy. This networks allows for instantaneous three-dimensional holographic communications at virtually any distance, making it one of the primary means of communication. Government agencies, such as the military, typically maintain their own encrypted circuits on the HoloNet. Some experienced slicers have been able to access these encrypted channels, though it required access to a government compound for the requisite codes.

### METOSP (Message to Spacers)
Upon arrival in a star system, most starships immediately connect to a specialized frequency responsible for communicating with incoming and outbound ships, called Message to Spacers, or METOSP. The METOSP message typically conveys a repeated greeting with information about flight hazards (such as blockades, weather, debris, or collisions) and relevant local regulations or customs (such as embargoes, tariffs, or landing procedures). All METOSPs are broadcast in Galactic Basic, though some worlds also broadcast in their native language. A METOSP provides pilots with contact information for spaceport control as well as information on landing patterns and traffic lanes. Most METOSPs are brief, repeating messages that refer listeners to other channels for specific information.

### Planetary Information Channels
Most planets also provide incoming space traffic with basic computer communication channels. These channels connect the ship to planetary information networks that provide everything from communications directory assistance to tourism information and planetary maps. Planetary information channels allow use of the Technology skill to access information relevant to the planet, and it possible for a slicer to access other functions.

## Time
In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In an enclosed environment, the adventurers� movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to navigate an asteroid field, a minute to dock in a space port, and a good 10 minutes to clear customs.

While traveling in realspace, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach a pirate stronghold on the other side of the planet travel those 150 miles in just over an hour.

In hyerspace, however, a scale of days works best. Following the road from Tatooine to Kashyyk, the adventurers spend four uneventful days before a pirate ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast�paced situations, the game relies on rounds, a 6�second span of time described in chapter 9.

## Movement and Travel
There are two significant travel types: Realspace and Hyperspace. 

\columnbreak

### Travel in Realspace
All starships have sublight engines that propel them through realspace, using them when taking off, landing, or flying within a gravity sphere. Coupled with an ion drive, ships are capable of incredible acceleration. 

When traveling in realspace, the GM can summarize the adventurers� movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: "You fly around the planet, reaching the stronghold late in the evening." 

Sometimes it�s important, though, to know how far, how fast, and how maneuverable your ship is in a short window of time. Starships come equipped with two speeds: **flying speed** and **turning speed**. 

#### Flying Speed
**Flying speed** is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels, it expends one foot from its speed.

#### Turning Speed
**Turning speed** determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to turn 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your **flying speed**. The amount you must spend equals your **turning speed**. For instance, if your ship has a **flying speed** of 350 feet, and a **turning speed** of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your **flying speed**, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your **flying speed**, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.

A ship can turn more or less than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

If a ship's **turning speed** exceeds its **flying speed**, treat its **turning speed** as equal to its **flying speed**.

#### Travel Pace
While traveling in realspace, a starship can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace. While traveling at a fast pace, your starship's flying speed is doubled, but your starship�and its crew�have disadvantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks. While traveling at a slow pace, your flying speed is halved, but you can travel stealthily. A fast pace makes a ship less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the �Activity While Traveling� section later in this chapter for more information).

You can use the following Sample Realspace Travel Times table to determine travel times in realspace for an average starship traveling at a normal pace.

#### Sample Realspace Travel Times
|Distance|Time Required|
|:--|--:|
|Surface of planet to orbit|1-5 minutes|
|Orbit to safe hyperspace jump distance|1 minute|
|Orbit to planet's moon|10-30 minutes|
|Orbit to another planet in the same system|2-6 hours|
|Orbit to outer edge of system|12-24 hours|

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Difficult Terrain
The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume unobstructed terrain. But adventurers often face narrow canyons, tight formations, or other difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain�moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed�so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Activity While Traveling
As adventurers travel on their starship, they need to remain alert for danger, and some characters might perform other tasks to help the group�s journey.

#### Deployment Order
While traveling, adventurers want to determine who is deployed where.

A deployment order makes it easier to determine which characters can spot hidden enemies or anomalies, and which ones are the closest to their station in case a fight breaks out.

A character might occupy the cockpit, a gunner station, or a relevant suite. The closer they are to their preferred deployment, the less time they have to spend getting to it.

> A ship might encounter a hostile ship while some crew members are resting or relaxing instead of deployed. It is up to the GM to determine how long it takes each crew member to deploy.

#### Stealth
While traveling at a slow pace, the starship can move stealthily. As long as they�re not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other starships they encounter. See the rules for hiding in chapter 7.

#### Noticing Threats
Use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine whether anyone in the starship notices a hidden threat. The GM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by deployed characters. For example, as the characters are traveling through an asteroid field, the GM might decide that only those characters deployed in a rear-facing deployment have a chance to spot a stealthy starship following the group, while characters deployed elsewhere cannot. While traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.

***Encountering Starships.*** If the GM determines that the adventurers encounter another starship while they�re traveling, it�s up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a dialogue, run away, or wait to see what the other group does.

***Surprising Foes.*** If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the GM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.

\columnbreak

#### Other Activities
Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels are not focused on watching for danger. These characters don�t contribute their passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group�s chance of noticing hidden threats. However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the GM�s permission.

***Navigate.*** The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making an Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master�s Guide* has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)

***Maintain a Map.*** The character can maintain a map that records the group�s progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

***Track.*** A character can follow the tracks of another starship, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the GM calls for it. (The *Dungeon Master�s Guide* has rules for tracking.)

> ##### Splitting Up the Party
> Splitting up the party is more difficult when your party only has one ship. Should they acquire a fleet of their own, however, they can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own deployment order.
>
> The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy ships moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier ships would alert. A X-wing moving at a slow pace is much harder to detect than the Corellian Corvette they leave behind.

### Travel in Hyperspace
The fastest way to travel long distances in space is through hyperspace. When a starship engages its hyperdrive, it accelerates beyond the speed of light and enters hyperspace. A starship in hyperspace can't communicate with ships in realspace. It is effectively cut off from realspace while in hyperspace.

Large objects that generate significant gravity, such as planets and stars, produce what is known as a "mass shadow" that projects into hyerspace. Collision with a mass shadow can have catastrophic repercussions. Hyperdrives have built-in safeguards that prevent a ship from jumping to hyperspace while inside of a mass shadow, causing a ship to immediately revert to realspace if the mass shadow is detected. Interdiction vesssels use gravity well generators to keep ships from activating their hyperdrives. Some pirates have been known to drag asteroids into hyperspace lanes in order to drag prey out of hyperspace.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Travel Pace
While traveling in hyperspace, a starship travels at a set speed as determined by the classification of the hyperdrive. A class 1 hyperdrive travels at the speed of light, while a class 2 hyperdrive travels at half the speed of light, and a class .5 hyperdrive travels at twice the speed of light. 

The galaxy at large is divided into territories, which are in turn subdivided into sectors. Traveling from one planet to another in the same sector takes less time than traveling from one planet to another in a different sector of the same territory. Consequently, traveling to a planet in a different territory takes even longer.

You can use the following Sample Hyperspace Travel Times table below to determine travel times. These times assume a class 1 hyperdrive.

#### Sample Hyperspace Travel Times
|Distance|Time Required|
|:--|--:|
|Planet in same sector|1-2 days|
|Planet in different sector in same territory|3-6 days|
|Planet in different territory|7-14 days|

#### Detecting Hyperspace Travel
When a starship enters or exits hyperspace, it generates a short burst of radiation. Any facility with adequate sensor arrays can detect this radiation burst with a DC 20 Intelligence (Technology) check. Success would indicate that a ship entered or exited the system as well as the point of arrival or departure. If the result of the check is over 25, the angle of departure can be determined, indicating possible destinations.

#### Astrogation
Plotting a hyperspace course requires incredibly difficult calculations; normally, only a truly brilliant individual can perform this feat unaided. Before jumping to hyperspace, a ship must plot a course via astrogation. A deployed operator can calculate astronavigation with an Intelligence check. The DC of the check is determined by how long they spent calculating, as shown below in the Astrogation Time Taken table.

#### Astrogation Time Taken
|Time Taken|DC|
|:--|:--:|
|10 minutes|10|
|1 minute|20|
|6 seconds|30|

Additionally, the accuracy of the check is affected by how old the astrogation information is. If the astrogation information is less than a day old, the operator has advantage on the check. If the information is older than a week, however, they have disadvantage on the check.

On a success, the operator accurately charts the hyperspace jump. Failing this check, however, results in a hyperspace mishap (see the Hyerspace Mishaps table below).

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:16px'></div>

&emsp;**The BoSS:** In addition to their duties of regulating information regarding ship ownership, they BoSS also maintains a database of astrogation information. Each time a ship docks in a major spaceport, they can update their astrogation data for a 150 credit fee. Astrogation data is routinely updated and is rarely more than a week old.

#### Hyperspace Hazards
Traveling through hyperspace can be incredibly dangerous. If a starship is disabled because of a poorly plotted hyperspace course, the GM usually chooses the point at which the ship drops out of hyperspace at random. GMs looking for a more in-depth description of a hyperspace mishap can consult the table below.

#### Hyperspace Mishaps
|D20&emsp;|Result|
|:--:|:--|
|1-5|Internal computer systems overload. Technology checks aboard the starship are made with disadvantage until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|6-10|Intense gravity warps the vessel's structual integrity. Piloting checks are made with disadvantage until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|11-15|Starship collides with small debris. The ship's hull immediately takes kinetic damage equal to one-tenth of its max HP, and shields regenerate at half their normal rate until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|16-19|The hyperdrive suffers a catastrophic failure, and is rendered unusable until the ship undergoes maintenance.
|20|Reroll on the above table twice|

### Landing Gear
All ships, regardless of size, come with integrated landing gear, complete with magnetic clamps. A ship can use its landing gear to bind itself another ship of a larger size. The landing gear can be engaged remotely from the cockpit, or manually in the event of primary system failure.

### Movement in Zero Gravity
In some circumstances, such as prolonged power failure, or movement in space outside of the ship, a character might find themselves moving in zero gravity.

While in zero gravity, a character has a flying speed equal to their walking speed, and zero gravity is treated as difficult terrain.

If a character already had a flying speed, they instead do not treat zero gravity as difficult terrain.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Crew Capacity
Ships have a minimum and maximum crew capacity determined by their size, modifications, and determined use. Most Small fighters, for instance, have a single crew member controlling all aspects of the ship. Medium ships, however, might have a crew of half a dozen, while larger ships have crews in the hundreds to hundreds of thousands. Regardless, ships have a minimum number of required crew members, as shown below on the Starship Size Minimum Crew table.

#### Starship Size Minimum Crew
|Starship Size|Minimum Crew|
|:--:|:--:|
|Tiny|�|
|Small|1|
|Medium|1|
|Large|200|
|Huge|4,000|
|Gargantuan|80,000|

The number of crew members that actively participate in combat, however, is much smaller. For coordinators, mechanics, operators, and pilots, each ship should only have one actively deployed crew member at a time. On ships where multiple people fill these roles, the chiefest and most experienced among them should be considered the deployed crew member for that role.

For gunners, the maximum number is equal to the number of hardpoints the ship has.

### Deployed
When a character is manning a deployment, they are considered deployed. A character can man multiple deployments simultaneously, provided they can access the controls for each deployment. For instance, in a Small ship, a single character can fulfill all five deployments simultaneously, since they can reach everything without moving. In a Medium ship, however, a single character can function as both pilot and operator, but probably can't reach the controls for the ship's weapons or the ship's engines to function as a gunner or mechanic. In Large and larger ships, most deployment stations are spread out so it's difficult for a deployed crew member to man more than one deployment.

While deployed in only one deployment, it is assumed you can have access to all features of that deployment.

\columnbreak

## The Environment
Starship exploration involves delving into the potentially dangerous, uncharted territory. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers, and their ships, interact with the environment. The Dungeon Master�s Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.

### Vision and Light
The most fundamental tasks of starfaring � noticing danger, finding hidden objects, and hitting an enemy ship in combat, to name just a few � rely heavily on a character�s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly obscured** area, such as dim light, dust clouds, or electrical storms, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

A **heavily obscured** area-such as darkness, opaque gases, or dense asteroids-blocks vision entirely. A creature in a heavily obscured area effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A).

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

**Bright light** lets most creatures see normally. 

**Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, and surrounding darkness. 

**Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area. 

#### Blindsight
A deployed operator on a starship equipped with a scanner can perceive their surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. 

#### Truesight
More advanced scanners offer truesight, allowing a deployed operator to detect starships that are completely invisible. Truesight allows a starship's scanners to automatically detect visual illusions and the deployed operator succeed on saving throws against them.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | ADVENTURING</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Repairs and Maintenance  
Over time, wear and tear on a ship accrues, forcing adventurers to temporarily abandon their pursuits to conduct repairs, and eventually maintenance. 

### Repairs
As long as a ship has a deployed mechanic, they can conduct makeshift repairs without having to dock the ship. Conducting repairs  requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Equipment Workforce table on page 55, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the Starship Size Repair Time table below.

#### Starship Size Repair Time
|Starship Size|Time&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|1 hour|
|Small|2 hours|
|Medium|8 hours|
|Large|1 day|
|Huge|2 days|
|Gargantuan|1 week|

If conducting repairs is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity�at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting powers, or similar adventuring activity�the workforce must begin repairs again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

Once repairs are conducted, a deployed mechanic can attempt to spend one or more Hit Dice, up to the starship's maximum number of Hit Dice, by making an Intelligence (Mechanic's kit) check. On a roll of 10 or less, you roll the Hit Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a roll of 11 to 20, you roll the Hit Die normally. On a roll of 21 or higher, you roll the Hit Die twice and take the greater amount.

For each Hit Dice spent in this way, the mechanic rolls the the die and adds the ship's Constitution modifier to it. The starship regains hit points equal to the total. The mechanic can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. 

### Maintenance
Maintenance is a period of extended downtime that requires docking at a spaceport or shipyard. Maintenance costs a number of credits proportionate to the number of hit points missing. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22. Conducting maintenance requires a workforce as shown in the Starship Size Upgrade Workforce table on page 22, and takes an amount of time depending on the size of starship, as shown in the Starship Size Maintenance Time table below.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

#### Starship Size Maintenance Time
|Starship Size|Time&nbsp;&nbsp;|
|:--|--:|
|Tiny|4 hours|
|Small|8 hours|
|Medium|1 day|
|Large|3 days|
|Huge|1 week|
|Gargantuan|1 month|

If conducting maintenance is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity�at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting powers, or similar adventuring activity�the workforce must begin maintenance again for the ship to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of maintenance, a ship regains all lost hit points and Hit Dice, and its system damage level is reduced by 1. 

#### Repairing the "Used" Condition
If the ship was "used" at the start of maintenance, the foremost mechanic can make a DC 30 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check. On a success, the cost of maintenance is increased, and the ship is no longer "used".

Repairing "used" costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hit points. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22. 

### Primary System Failure
In some instances, primary systems can experience failure. When primary systems fail, an integrated emergency back up will activate. This back up can continue running the starship, provided there is adequate fuel, for 24 hours. At the end of the 24-hour period, primary systems fail, causing all electrical systems, including life support to fail. 

Once a ship's primary systems, all functionality of the ship ceases to function. If the ship can be towed to a shipyard, it can still be repaired, however.

#### Repairing Primary Systems
If the ship's primary systems had failed at the start of maintenance, they can be repaired during that maintenance, increasing the cost but not the time.

Repairing primary systems costs a number of credits proportionate to the ship's maximum number of hit points. The amount is 10 credits per hit point multiplied by the Starship Size Upgrade Cost table on page 22.

# Chapter 9: Combat

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/TP83mUX.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:63px;width:35px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s the light freighter exits hyperspace, it finds<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself in the middle of a snubfighter skirmish. Immediately, the pilot begins evasive maneuvers while hollering for help. One crewmember hops into the copilot seat while two more run to opposite sides of the craft to man the gun batteries. Three of the snubfighters -- now identified as TIE fighters -- turn towards this new opponent and open fire, but the blasts dissipiate ineffectually on the freighter's shields. The freighter's two gunners, now in place, open fire on the assaulting craft. One takes the blasts directly to the cockpit and explodes in a blaze, while the other is hit on a solar panel and spins off out of control into the distance. The third attempts to pass overhead, but the copilot takes a shot from the freighter's slaved railgun and destroys the fighter in a single stroke.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and their craft to engage in space combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or GM. The GM controls all the other ships and nonplayer characters involved in space combat, and each other player controls either their own ship or a function of your ship. "You" can also mean the character or ship you control.

## The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of cannon shots and ship maneuvers. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A **round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a **turn.** The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.

### Surprise
An assault carrier exits hyperspace and immediately begins firing on its prey. Fighters rapidly exit bays to support and protect the craft. Their opponents, caught unawares, are slow to respond and take significant damage before mounting their defense. In this situation, one side of the battle gained surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any ship that doesn�t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you�re surprised, you can�t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can�t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren�t.

\columnbreak

> ##### Combat Step By Step
> **&emsp;1. Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
> 
> **2. Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the adventurers� marching order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are�how far away and in what direction.
> 
> **3. Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative normally, determining the order of combatants� turns.
> 
> **4. Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.
> 
> **5. Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

### Your Role On Your Turn
Your abilities depend on where you are deployed during space combat. In a snubfighter, you control all aspects of your craft: movement and maneuvering, weapons, operation, and engines. In a larger craft, however, your abilities are dependent on your role in the ship. You may be a gunner, a pilot, or a support crew member. The amount of control you have varies accordingly.

The �Movement and Position� section later in this chapter gives the rules for your move.

#### Actions
The actions available to you depend on where you are deployed at a given time. You might be firing a weapon, manipulating the engines, or interacting with a control panel. 

#### Bonus Actions
Various class or deployment features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can only take a bonus action if some feature gives you one, and you can only take one bonus action on each of your turns.

#### Other Activity on Your Turn
Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.

#### Reactions
Certain features allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. 

When you take a reactor, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Movement and Position
In combat, ships are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.

Sometimes it�s important, though, to know how far, how fast, and how maneuverable your ship is in a short window of time. Starships come equipped with two speeds: **flying speed** and **turning speed**. 

### Flying Speed
**Flying speed** is how far your ship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your ship travels, it expends one foot from its speed.

### Turning Speed
**Turning speed** determines how maneuverable your ship is. In order for your ship to turn 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your **flying speed**. The amount you must spend equals your **turning speed**. For instance, if your ship has a **flying speed** of 350 feet, and a **turning speed** of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your **flying speed**, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your **flying speed**, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.

A ship can turn more or less than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

> #### Variant: Playing on a Grid
> If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.
> 
> ***Squares.*** Each square on the grid represents 50 feet.
> 
> ***Speed.*** Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 50-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 50. For example, a speed of 300 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
> 
> If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.
> 
> ***Entering a Square.*** To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, unless the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you�re in (discussed below). 
> 
> ***Corners.*** Diagonal movement can�t cross the corner of an asteroid or other terrain feature that fills its space.
> 
> ***Ranges.*** To determine the range on a grid between two things�whether ships or objects�start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
>
> ***Diagonals.*** When measuring range or moving diagonally, the first diagonal square counts as 50 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 100 feet. This pattern of 50 feet and then 100 feet continues whenever you're counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For instance, a ship might move one square diagonally (50 feet), then three squares straight (150 feet), and then another square diagonally (100 feet) for a total movement of 300 feet.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

### Breaking Up Your Move
You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 300 feet, you can move 100 feet, take your action, and then move 200 feet.

#### Moving Between Attacks
If you take an action that includes more than one ship attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a ship that can make two attacks and that has a speed of 300 feet could move 100 feet, make an attack, move 200 feet, and then attack again.

### Difficult Terrain
Combat rarely takes place in featureless terrain. Asteroid fields, mountain ranges, tight formations�the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

The space of another ship, whether hostile or not, counts as difficult terrain.

### Moving Around Other Ships
You can move through a nonhostile ship's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile ship's space only if the ship is at least two sizes Larger or smaller than you. Remember that another ship's space is difficult terrain for your ship.

Whether a ship is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.

### Ship Size
Each ship takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a ship of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same categories.

#### Size Categories
|Size|Space|
|:--|:--|
|Tiny|Up to 25 ft.|
|Small|25 to 50 ft.|
|Medium|50 to 250 ft.|
|Large|250 to 2,500 ft.|
|Huge|2,500 to 25,000 ft.|
|Gargantuan|25,000 ft. or larger|

> #### Variant: Sizes on a Grid
> If you play out combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, consider scaling down the sizes of ships. A Tiny or Small ship should take up 1 quare, while a Medium ship takes up 2. A Large ship takes up 4 squares, a Huge 8, and a Gargantuan 16.

#### Space
A ship's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium ship isn't 100 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide.

## Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here (as appropriate for your deployment), an action you gained from your class, specialization, or some other feature, or an action that you improvise. 

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Attack
The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action. With this action, you can make an attack (or attacks) with one ship weapon you can reach. See the "Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern attacks. Once a ship weapon has been fired, it can't be fired again until the start of the deployed gunners turn. Only a deployed gunner can take the Attack action.

### Cast a Power
As normal, you can cast force or tech powers. You can not target a hostile creature with a power unless you are aware of their presence and location. Any deployed crew member take the Cast a Power action.

### Direct
You can direct another creature within 5 feet of you, aiding them in the completion of a task. When you take the Direct action, the creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can direct a friendly creature within 5 feet of you in attacking another target. If your ally attacks the target before the start of your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. Only a deployed coordinator can take the Direct action.

### Evade
When you take the Evade action, you make an Intelligence (Piloting) check contested by a target ship's Intelligence (Piloting) check. On a success, the first attack roll the target makes against you before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. On a failure, the first attack roll made by your ship against the target before the start of your next turn has disadvantage. Only a deployed pilot can take the Evade action.

### Hide
When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide your ship, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the "Unseen Attackers and Targets" section later in this chapter. Only a deployed pilot can take the Hide action.

### Interfere
You can attempt to interfere with another creature within 1,000 feet that is deployed on a ship, if you are aware of their presence and location, in the attempt of a task. When you take the Interfere action, you make an 

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:27px'></div>

Intelligence (Technology) check contested by the target's Intelligence (Technology) check. If you succeed, the subject has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. Only a deployed operator can take the Interfere action.

### Patch
You can attempt to patch up damage a ship has taken, using one of its Hit Dice. When you take the Patch action, you make an Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check (DC = 10 or half the ship's missing hit points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you roll the Hit Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a success you roll the Hit Die normally. Only a deployed mechanic can take the Patch action.

### Ram
You can attempt to ram another ship while flying through its space. As an action, you can force the opposing pilot to make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + the pilot's proficiency bonus + the ship's Strength modifier). On a failed save, both you and the target ship take kinetic damage equal to two of your ship's Hit Dice + your ship's Strength modifier. If your ship has shield points remaining, your ship instead takes half this damage. If the target ship is larger than your ship, it has disadvantage on the saving throw. If the target ship is smaller than your ship, it instead has advantage. Only a deployed pilot can take the Ram action.

### Ready
Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn so that you can act later in the round using your reaction. Any deployment can take the Ready action.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger. For instance, �When the starfighter comes into range, I'll shoot it with my railgun." 

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.

### Search
When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check. Any deployment can take the Search action.

### Use an Object
When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn. Any deployment can take the Use an Object action.

## Making an Attack
Whether you�re shooting your laser cannons or a railgun, an attack has a simple structure.

**1. Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack�s range: a ship, an object, or a location.

**2. Determine modifiers.** The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, powers, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.

**3. Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage. If there�s ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.

### Attack Rolls
When you make an attack with a primary or secondary weapon, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20, add your proficiency bonus (if proficient), the ship's Dexterity modifier, and any weapon-specific bonuses or penalties. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target�s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. 

If you are proficient with any martial weapons, you are considered proficient with a ship's weapons.

#### Rolling 1 or 20
Sometimes fate blesses or curses a gunner, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss. 

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target�s AC. In addition, the attack is a critical hit, as explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target�s AC.

#### Range
You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.

Ship weaponry typically has two ranges. The value of these ranges depends on the type of weapon (primary, secondary, or tertiary), as described in Chapter 5.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close combat
Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a ship weapon, a power, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 50 feet of your target.

### Firing Arc
Ships have a firing arc, which is determined by the hardpoint on which they are mounted. Fixed hardpoints offer a limited firing arc, while turret hardpoints have an unlimited firing arc.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:26px'></div>

#### Limited Firing Arc
Many weapons, such as forward- or rear-mounted laser cannons, can only fire in a single direction, indicated by a limited firing arc. These weapons can only fire at targets within a cone, with the weapon's fixed hardpoint as the cone's point of origin. The cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that points distance from the point of origin. 

#### Unlimited Firing Arc
Weapons with an unlimited firing arc can fire at any target within range and line of sight.

### Saving Throws
While primary and secondary weapons utilize an attack roll, tertiary and quaternary weapons instead call for a saving throw. The saving throw is calculated as follows:

___

<div align='center'>

**Weapon save DC** = 8 + the gunner's proficiency bonus (if proficient) + the ship's Dexterity modifier

</div>

___

### Damage Rolls
Each ship weapon specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add the ship's Dexterity modifier, and apply the damage to your target. Higher quality weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage.

#### Critical Hits
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack�s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack�s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.

#### Damage Types
Starship combat relies on four different damage types.

***Energy.*** The most common type of damage done by primary ship weapons, dealing normal damage to armor and shields.

***Kinetic.*** The most common type of damage done by secondary ship weapons, dealing normal damage to armor and shields. Additionally, when ships collide with eachother or debris, they deal kinetic damage.

***Pulse.*** Pulse damage is more effective against shields than armor. Shields take double damage from pulse weapons, while armor takes half.

***Thermite.*** Thermite damage is more effective against armor than shields. Armor takes double damage from thermite weapons, while shields take half.

### Damage Resistance and Vulnerability
Some ships might have resistance or vulnerability to a damage type. If a ship has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a ship has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.

Resistance, and then vulnerability, are applied after all other modifiers to damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count only as one instance.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\pagebreakNum

## Cover
Asteroids, ships, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a ship that gives half cover and an asteroid that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of it. 

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarter cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. 

A target with **total cover** can�t be targeted directly by an attack, although some powers can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.

\columnbreak

## Damage and Repairs
Space combat is lethal, and players always run a risk by engaging in it. A well placed cannon shot, a proton torpedo, or a seismic charge all have the potential to damage, or outright destroy, a ship.

### Hit Points
Hit points represent a ship's hull integrity. A ship's current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the ship's hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a ship takes damage or receives repairs.

Whenever a ship takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a ship's capabilities until the ship drops to 0 hit points.

### Shield Points
Often, a ship will have a buffer of energy called a shield. Ship's equipped in such a way of shield points in addition to hit points.

Whenever a ship with shield points takes damage, the shield takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ship's shield points to 0, the hull takes any remaining damage. For instance, if your ship has 5 shield points and takes 7 damage, your ship loses its shield points and then take 2 damage to your ship's hit points.

### Repairs
Damage to hulls is permanent until repaired. Small repairs can happen while the ship is still in space, but significant repairs require docking in an appropriate location, as discussed in Chapter 8.

When a ship receives repairs of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A ship�s hit points can�t exceed its hit point maximum.

<div class='footnote'>PART 2 | COMBAT</div>

\pagebreakNum

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points
When a ship is reduced to 0 hit points, it is either destroyed or disabled. If the ship is not instantly destroyed, the ship suffers 1 level of system damage and becomes disabled.

> ##### Describing the Effects of Damage
> GMs describe hit point loss in different ways. When your ship's current hit point total is half or more of your hit point maximum, it typically shows no signs of damage. When it drops below half its hit point maximum, you show signs of wear, such as electrical fires or dislodged machinery. An attack that reduces your ship to 0 hit points strikes directly, leaving a massive hole or otherwise disables the ship.

#### Instantly Destroyed
Massive damage can destroy a ship instantly. When damage reduces a ship to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the ship explodes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point point maximum.

#### Destruction Saving Throws
Whenever you start your turn and your ship has 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a destruction saving throw, to determine whether or not you're able to salvage your ship. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn�t tied to any ability score; you are in the hands of fate now. Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, your ship becomes stable (see below). On a failure, your ship suffers 1 level of system damage. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three successes, or your ship's primary systems fail. 

***Rolling 1 or 20.*** When you make a destruction saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures, causing 2 levels of system damage. If you roll a 20 on the d20, your ship regains 1 hit point.

***Damage at 0 Hit Points.*** If your ship takes any damage while it has 0 hit points, it suffers 1 level of system damage. If the damage is from a critical hit, it suffers 2 levels of system damage instead. If the damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum, it is instantly destroyed.

\columnbreak

<div style='margin-top:23px'></div>

#### Stabilizing a Ship
The best way to stablize a ship with 0 hit points is to repair it. If repairs are unavailable, the ship can at least be stabilized so that it isn�t killed by a failed destruction saving throw.

A deployed mechanic can use their action to attempt repairs on a disabled ship and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Mechanic's Kit) check.

A **stable** ship doesn�t make destruction saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain disabled. The ship stops being stable, and must start making destruction saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable ship that isn�t repaired regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

#### Ships and Destruction
Most GMs have a ship explode the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than disabling it and having it make destruction saving throws. Special ships are common exceptions; the GM might have them be disabled and follow the same rules as player ships.

### Disabling a Ship
Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a ship, rather than destroy it. When an attacker reduces a ship to 0 hit points with a primary weapon, the attacker can disable the ship. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The ship is disabled and stable.

# Appendix A: Conditions

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/4mYR4C0.png' style='position:absolute;top:78px;left:62px;width:30px' />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;onditions alter a starship's capabilities in a variety<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ways and can arise as a result of a power, a starship feature, or some other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. 

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a starship, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A starship either has a condition or doesn't.

Any conditions that reference the ship also apply to any crew members when they take actions involving the ship. For instance, an ionized ship has disadvantage on attack rolls. Consequently, a deployed gunner would have disadvantage on attack rolls with a ship weapon, but not with their own weapons.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded
- A blinded ship can't see and automatically fails any ability check that relies on sight or the ship's sensors.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage, and the ship's attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Disabled
- A disabled ship can't communicate with external sources more than 1,000 feet away.
- A disabled ship can't take actions or reactions.
- A disabled ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

#### Ionized
- An ionized starship has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

#### Invisible
- An invisible starship is impossible to see without the aid of powers or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the starship is heavily obscured. The starship's location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
- Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature's attack rolls have advantage.

#### Shocked
- A shocked starship's speed is reduced by half.
- The starship can't take reactions.

#### Stalled
- A stalled ship is disabled (see the condition).
- Any active features controlled by the ship, such as a Tractor Beam or Gravity Well Projector, automatically end.
- The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

\columnbreak

#### Stunned
- A stunned ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The ship automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
- Attack rolls against the ship have advantage.

#### System Damage
Some special abilities, or when certain conditions are met, cause a ship to sustain a special condition called system damage. such as and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called system damage. System damage is measured in six levels. An effect can give a starship one or more levels of system damage, as specified in the effect's description.

|Level|Effect|
|:--:|:--|
|1|Disadvantage on ability checks|
|2|Flying speed halved and turning speed doubled|
|3|Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws|
|4|Hit point maximum, shield point maximum, and shield regeneration rate halved|
|5|Ship becomes permanently "used" (see the condition)|
|6|Ship suffers catastrophic power failure. All primary systems fail.|

If a ship with system damage suffers another effect that causes system damage, its current level of system damage increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A ship suffers the effect of its current level of system damage as well as all lower levels. For example, a ship suffering level 2 system damage has its flying speed halved, turning speed doubled, and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes system damage reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all system damage effects (except for "used") ending if a ship's system damage level is reduced below 1.

Finishing maintenance reduces a ship's system damage level by 1.

#### Tractored
- A tractored ship's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the tractoring ship is disabled (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the tractored ship from the reach of the tractoring ship or effect.

#### Used
- A used starship's value is reduced by half.
- When crew member on a used starship rolls a 1 on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, they must make a destruction saving throw. If the roll is 10 or higher, they succeed. On a failure, your ship suffers 1 level of system damage.
